                "Instead of some must-pass bills--and I will suggest a few--what we have heard from my good friends on the other side are some tax and other giveaway bills that add to the deficit or bills that should be stamped ``special interest.''",

                "For me, however, the biggest piece of missing legislation is the reauthorized transportation bill, and I say that because that would have been the functional equivalent of the JOBS Act of 2014; instead, we are going to leave here this evening, having given nothing to the American people to assure them that there will be jobs for the 7 weeks that we are gone. That is what they most wanted. That is what we have been given least.",

Closing the Congress with a bunch of never-to-pass bills that nobody envisioned would be taken up will never make up for the shameful record of the 113th Congress."

                "This amendment reinforces our commitment to the middle class and making sure that jobs are created right here in America, not overseas, by taking five key steps.", 
                "First, it would extend the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank for 7 years. Illinois companies like John Deere and Caterpillar, as well as large and small businesses across our country, deserve the certainty that a long-term reauthorization would provide.", 
                "Second, it would help ensure that employers provide equal pay for equal work. Equal pay is not simply a women's issue. It is an issue for all in the middle class. With households being led by women, equal pay will help those families get further ahead. Boosting women's earnings also will increase the purchasing power of families and will help our economy.", 
                "Third, my amendment will make the minimum wage a living wage. The cost of living has skyrocketed in recent years, but wages have remained stagnant. Working full time, year round at Illinois' $8.25 minimum wage will earn a worker only $16,500 per year, a salary that is below the Federal poverty line.", 
                "Raising the minimum wage would not only lift many families out of poverty, but it would also increase the earning power of households across the country, leading to an increase in overall economic activity.", 
                "Fourth, my amendment would allow students with outstanding student loan debt to refinance their loans at the lower interest rates that are currently offered to borrowers. Student loan debt not only harms young people and prevents them from reaching their personal financial potential, such as purchasing a home and starting a family, but it is deadweight, pulling down our entire economy and preventing economic growth.", 
                "Fifth, and finally, my amendment would prevent government contracts from going to companies that have moved their operations overseas. The government should not be giving taxpayer dollars to companies that ship jobs overseas and take advantage of corporate inversions to avoid paying their fair share.", 
                "These five commonsense elements would strengthen the middle class and help create jobs right here in America. Too many families are struggling, and enough is enough. For too long, lawmakers have been looking out for themselves instead of looking out for the middle class.", 
                "I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

                "Next year, the Nation will celebrate the 95th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women, at long last, the right to vote. The result of more than four decades of advocacy from such giants of the women's equality movement as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the amendment was merely a first step in advancing women's rights.", 
                "Since the ratification of the 19th Amendment, there has been considerable progress in the march for gender equality. The President's Commission on the Status of Women, established by President Kennedy and directed by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, in part led to formation of the National Organization for Women. NOW's core issues include two on which this Congress has been rightly focused: ending violence against women, and promoting economic justice.", 
                "The country last week celebrated the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act. This landmark law shined a light on the scourge of domestic violence and improved the criminal justice system's response to these cases. Last year, Congress again came together to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA to address the evolving needs of domestic and sexual violence victims, and to ensure that those protections are available to all victims, regardless of sexual orientation, ethnicity, race or gender. The VAWA reauthorization law, which I was proud to author, was just one example of how we must continue to build on the historic work of past years in advancing equal rights and opportunities for American women.", 
                "And earlier this week, the Senate yet again tried to move forward with legislation to address pay equality. Building on more than 50 years of progress, starting with the Civil Rights Act, which barred employment discrimination based on race and gender, and on the heels of the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act would take a significant step toward ensuring a balanced and equal environment for women in the workplace. Unfortunately, for the fourth time, partisan objections have prevented the Senate from advancing this legislation to hold employers accountable and to protect employees from retaliation for discussing their salaries with colleagues. Vermont has adopted its own Equal Pay Act, making it illegal for employers to offer anything less than equal pay for equal work. Still, in Vermont, where 22,000 households are headed by women, the yearly gender pay gap is nearly $6,000. More needs to be done, and we can do better.", 
                "This year, Vermont will mark two important anniversaries. Thirty years ago, Vermont voters sent the first woman in our history to the State House to serve as Governor. Madeleine Kunin, a trailblazer in Vermont, served for 6 years as Governor, before becoming a Deputy Secretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. As a child, she fled the threat of the Holocaust, leaving Switzerland with her family for the hope and promise of America. She returned to the country that she had been forced to flee when President Clinton appointed her to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland. She continues to lead and inspire as an author, educator, mentor to women in politics, and tireless advocate for women's rights.", 
                "Later this year, the Vermont Women's Fund will celebrate 20 years of supporting women, both in the workplace and at home. The Fund helps women overcome economic hardships to live secure and successful lives. The Fund guides young women to opportunities in nontraditional career paths and propels future leaders to reach their goals. As we well know, when women are given an equal opportunity, their achievements are elevated. When women are given equal opportunities, they thrive and often rise to the top. When women are given a fair shot, their contributions at home, in the workplace and in our communities make us all better. The Vermont Women's Fund, with its diverse and representative council, works to establish and preserve that progress for Vermonters.", 
                "In the nearly 95 years since the Nation came together to belatedly extend the right to vote to women, we have made considerable strides in advancing gender equality. More than two dozen women lead Fortune 500 companies, an achievement once viewed as unattainable to young women entering the workforce. Women have risen to some of the highest ranks in our government. Women now comprise a majority of students enrolled in college. In Vermont, we are proud of our history in advancing women's rights. Leaders like Madeleine Kunin, and programs like the Vermont Women's Fund, are shining examples of why Vermont is a leader in this social progress for women and our entire society. And we are proud to be a national leader in the advancement of women. Congress, and the country, can learn and benefit from Vermont's trailblazing example."

However, after we consider that, we will proceed again on the partisan messaging bills of which I spoke. This, unfortunately, has been the pattern throughout the 112th and the 113th, this Congress.",

                "Madam Speaker, the American public will have a choice between a stark contrast of who is on their side. Let's hope the next Congress is a Congress of which the American people can be proud."

                "Yesterday we had a vote on a labor issue. This was a vote as to whether men and women in the workplace working the same jobs get the same pay. Most people would say: Well, isn't that the law already? Yes.", 
                "Unfortunately, the law as written in 1963 with the Equal Pay Act isn't working very well. In a lot of workplaces women are paid less. In the State of Illinois, it is about 75 cents for every dollar paid to a man for most women unless you happen to be an African man and then it is 65 cents, or Hispanic, it is 65 cents. The actual working relationships in many businesses discriminate against women.", 
                "We offered a bill yesterday to the Equal Pay Act brought to the floor by Senator Mikulski of Maryland and Senator Boxer of California. We asked if we could now revisit the Equal Pay Act to make sure it is enforceable and that it works so that literally if my son or my daughter ended up with the same job and the same workplace and the same work record, they would get the same pay. Not a radical idea by any measure. That was what we brought up for a vote yesterday.", 
                "I took a look at the Congressional Record to refresh my memory and talked with the staff. Not one Republican Senator would vote for that bill--not one. There were 52 votes in favor of moving forward on this bill. All of them were from the Democratic side.", 
                "So when I listen to these calls for reform when it comes to labor laws and bipartisanship when it comes to labor laws, my obvious question to my friends on the other side of the aisle is: Where were you yesterday? We had a chance here on the floor of the Senate to do something on a bipartisan basis for pay equity, equal pay for men and women in the workplace.", 
                "This is not the first time we faced this issue. Lilly Ledbetter became somewhat legendary in America. This lady, whom I had the privilege to meet a few times, had a tough job. She worked at a tire manufacturing facility in Alabama. She worked hard for a long time. As she was nearing retirement, someone went up to her and said: Lilly, you have been a manager around here a lot of years, but they are paying you a heck of a lot less than the men who have the same job in this plant. She didn't quit.", 
                "They don't publish the wages of all coworkers so that you would know this. She was upset about it. She spent all those years working there and she was being discriminated against because she was a woman. She filed a lawsuit, as she was entitled to under the law, saying that this was discriminatory and she was entitled to back pay for this discrimination.", 
                "The Supreme Court, right across the street, threw out the lawsuit and said she didn't report this discrimination in a timely fashion. She didn't report that she was being paid less within a certain number of months, and her response was: How would I even know that? I don't know what that man who was the manager next to me is being paid any more than he knows what I am being paid.", 
                "That is what the Supreme Court decided.", 
                "The first bill that was signed into law by President Obama, the Lilly Ledbetter Act, said that Lilly Ledbetter and people like her at a future time would be allowed to sue for back wages if they were discriminated against.", 
                "Very few, if any, Republicans supported this. When I hear speeches on the floor about reforming labor laws and the workplace laws in America, let's do it in a bipartisan fashion. When it got down to the real basics, S. 2199 yesterday, not a single Republican would join us, not one. I would think they would feel as we do. It is only fair. It is only fair that if you are in the workplace doing the same job, you get the same pay. Unfortunately, not one of them would. So when they call for reforming the National Labor Relations Board and they call for bipartisanship, I think it should start right here when it comes to legislation that comes before the Senate.", 
                "I also listened to the Republican Senate leader come to the floor today and talk about the state of our economy. I wonder sometimes if Members of the Senate, who are entitled to their own opinions, should also be entitled to their own facts because what the Senator from Kentucky failed to note was the economy which President Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009. It was in sad shape.", 
                "What a contrast from 8 years before when President Bill Clinton left office in January of 2001, 14 years ago. We had gone through a period of 4 straight years of Federal budget surplus. A Democratic President, 4 straight years of Federal budget surplus, and President Clinton left to the new President, George W. Bush, a surplus in the next year's budget of $120 billion, if my memory serves me.", 
                "The last time that happened, 4 straight years of surplus, had been 40 years before. So here is Democratic President Clinton leaving office to President George W. Bush with a string of surpluses in the budget that we hadn't seen for four decades.", 
                "In addition, President Clinton was taking the surplus and investing it in Social Security so that it was stronger than it had been in years because of the surpluses.", 
                "During the period of the Clinton Presidency, 23 million new jobs were created in this country. Eight years, 23 million jobs, and government spending was still growing each year. Yet there were surpluses, job creation, and economic growth in the 8-year period of time.", 
                "When President Clinton left office, the national debt that had been accumulated over the entire history of the United States totaled $5 trillion. That was January of 2001. He handed that economy and that budget to President George W. Bush.", 
                "Now fast forward 8 years. What did President George W. Bush hand to new President Barack Obama? One of the weakest economies America had seen since the Great Depression. The month President Obama took the oath of office in January of 2009, when he put his hand on the same Bible Abraham Lincoln used when he was sworn in as President, that month we lost nearly 800,000 jobs in America. That previous year, private employers had shed more than 4 million jobs. We know what happened to savings and retirement accounts. They were devastated by that recession. The economy was shrinking.", 
                "In just 8 years, President George W. Bush took one of the strongest, fastest growing economies in American history and, sadly, turned it into an economic recession. How did he do it? Tax breaks for wealthy people and wars that were not paid for. Those were the two things that drove us from a $5 trillion debt when President Clinton left office--cumulative debt in the history of America.", 
                "When President George W. Bush left office, handing it over to President Obama, the national debt had broken $5 trillion to $12 trillion. It more than doubled in the 8-year period of time. So President Obama had a challenge. Get the economy back on its feet.", 
                "Right now, Public Television has a series on the Roosevelts. I have enjoyed it because Ken Burns is one of the best. He is telling the story of Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt.", 
                "We remember what happened when Franklin Roosevelt came to office at the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, facing the Great Depression in America. He said: We have to get America back to work. That is what President Obama says. The stimulus package. Let's get back to work here. Let's put people earning paychecks into a position where they can save their homes and keep their families together and rebuild the economy. He got almost no help from the other side of the aisle.", 
                "Remember the automobile industry. Remember what was happening in the automobile industry when President Obama took over office from President Bush. It was flat on its back. Two major companies, Chrysler and General Motors, were facing bankruptcy and even the prospect of going out of business.", 
                "President Obama said: We cannot let this happen. There are too many good-paying jobs across America. He stepped in and helped by loaning money to these automobile companies to get back on their feet.", 
                "Just last week I had some auto dealers from the Chicagoland area come to see me in my office. One said, Do you know what happened? We were selling about 9 million cars when the recession hit. Now we are back on our feet. We are up to 16 million a year. The automobile industry is coming back strong.", 
                "I look at Illinois and I can see it in Belvidere where the Fiat Chrysler plant is working three shifts. I see it at the Ford plant on the South Side of Chicago. They are working three shifts as well.", 
                "President Obama said: Let's get back to work. Let's save the auto industry. He did. Now they come to the floor and say: You know, it just hasn't been fast enough.", 
                "When it came to the stimulus package, we had little or no support from the other side of the aisle. When it came to rebuilding my State of Illinois and across the country, it was resistance.", 
                "Then comes the issue of health insurance. I want to say a word about that. I have voted for the Affordable Care Act. It may be one of the most important votes ever cast.", 
                "I did it for personal reasons because I personally experienced with my family a moment when we had no health insurance.", 
                "My wife and I got married very young. I was still in law school. God sent us a baby. She had some medical issues. We had no health insurance. I was going to school here at Georgetown Law School. I would leave class, pick up my wife and baby and go to the charity ward at Children's Hospital in Washington, DC.", 
                "We were sitting in there with a number in my hand waiting to see who would walk through that door to be the doctor to save my baby's life. I had no health insurance. I have never felt more helpless as a husband and father than at that moment.", 
                "I believe today, as I did then, that should never happen to any family. I believe this great Nation should provide basic health care for everyone living in this great Nation. That is why I voted for the Affordable Care Act.", 
                "What has happened since? Eight million Americans are now insured under the Affordable Care Act. We have seen an 8-percent decline in uninsured people in my home State and many States.", 
                "One of the most successful States when it comes to the Affordable Care Act happens to be the Commonwealth of Kentucky which the Republican Senate leader represents.", 
                "They have signed up in substantial numbers. Hundreds of thousands of people in his State now have health insurance because the Affordable Care Act, which some characterize in a friendly or derogatory way as ObamaCare, has worked.", 
                "What has it meant in Illinois? Some 640,000 people in Illinois now have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. In a State of about 13 million people, that is a substantial number, and 400,000 of them were low-wage workers who had no benefits in their job and now qualify for Medicaid. They have health insurance.", 
                "I met one of them, Rich Romanowski. What a perfect Chicago name, right? Rich, a big barrel-chested Polish guy, is a musician. He has done part-time work all his life and he never had health insurance. Now he is in his sixties. Rich came to one of our press conferences, smacked his wallet, and said: I have a card in my wallet that says I have health insurance for the first time in my life.", 
                "He is not the only one. He is one of 400,000 in my State, which means when they get sick and go to the hospital, their bills are not passed on to the rest of us, to all the people with insurance, to those who use Medicare. They have their own insurance now, and it means they are going to be healthier.", 
                "I think of Judy. Judy works in Southern Illinois. She works in one of the motels that I stay in there, and she is a hospitality lady. When people go for breakfast, she is the one greeting us and showing us where to sit down. Judy is about 62 years old, a hard-working Southern Illinois lady and one of the sweetest people we would ever want to meet. Judy got health insurance for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act, and it is a good thing she did because she has just been diagnosed with diabetes. She needs good care because diabetes, if not treated right, can lead to serious complications: blindness, amputations. Judy has that health insurance.", 
                "Remember when the government shut down last year, Senator Cruz of Texas came and read Dr. Seuss books to us. I came to the floor and said to him: You tell us you are shutting down the government to protest the Affordable Care Act. Well, what do you say about Judy? Judy, who has worked in Southern Illinois all her life, has no health insurance, needs it, and is now going to get it under Medicaid. Are you going to tell me we are going to do away with this law now and take away her health insurance? What would you say to her?", 
                "Senator Cruz said on the record on the Senate floor: Judy needs to get a better job.", 
                "I think many times folks in the Senate need to get the heck out of the Capitol, get out, meet the rest of America, and come to understand they are working hard every day, they are not getting paid a whole lot of money, and basic health insurance is beyond their reach, beyond their grasp. Well, the Affordable Care Act changed that, and we are not going back.", 
                "The House has voted over 50 times to repeal that law, and I say that as long as Barack Obama is President, that is not going to work. He is not going to let them do it. I am going to stand with him because I happen to be one of those persons who had a member of my family with a preexisting condition--the situation with my daughter.", 
                "I know the kind of discrimination that people with preexisting conditions used to face before the Affordable Care Act. We are not going back to those days. This Senator and this President for sure, we are going to fight all the way to make sure that health insurance is there for those who are struggling in their work and there for families that would otherwise not have a chance."

                "When our colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose simple measures such as a fair shot at getting out of poverty if a person works 40 hours a week, a fair shot for a woman to get equal pay to a man, and a fair shot to prevent jobs from being sent overseas to get a tax break, they know what we are talking about. Perhaps no issue resonates more than a fair shot for people to be able to afford college and then repay their loans with a reasonable amount of money.", 
                "Probably the greatest problem America faces is the decline of middle-class incomes. They have been declining since 2001. If they continue to decline for another decade, whoa is America, whoa is America.", 
                "America has been expanded--has grown to the greatest country in the world on the notion of opportunity. In my harbor sits a lady with a torch. That torch symbolizes the American dream to just about every American and most citizens in the world. What is the American dream? What does that torch symbolize? If we ask the average American, they wouldn't put it in fancy words or highfalutin language. They would say: It means if I work hard, I will be doing better 10 years from now than I am doing today, and my kids will be doing better than I.", 
                "Nothing keeps that American dream burning more brightly than the ability to afford a college education.", 
                "The bottom line is simple. The statistics show that in our new and technological world, those who have a college education, whether it is an A.A. degree or a B.A. degree or higher, do a lot better economically than everybody else. Amazingly enough, they do better in other ways in terms of how good their health is, in terms of their longevity, in terms of their happiness.", 
                "So college, which used to be a rare commodity 100 years ago, is now almost a necessity to millions of Americans. Yet it is so expensive. It is expensive in two ways. First, it is hard to get there. We have been working very hard on the American opportunity tax break, which my friend from Michigan mentioned, reducing the rate of student loans for those who are already in college, and many other ideas we have pursued to try to make college affordable for families who have someone in college or will enter college in future years.", 
                "There is another huge problem as well. Those who have been to college have huge amounts of debt and they are paying this government far more interest than would be paid on the market. We can refinance almost everything--mortgages, cars, loans on jewelry--but we cannot refinance college loans the government has given us. So people are paying 6, 7, 8 percent; whereas, if they went to a bank on their own, they would pay less.", 
                "How dare the Federal Government make money on the backs of young people who are struggling to pay back their debt. Boy, does it hurt those families. It prevents them from starting businesses, buying homes, going on vacation, and many delay their marriages. So there could be nothing that would make millions and millions of Americans happier economically. There could be nothing that would help people get a fair shot and a decent education, the ability to repay, than this simple bill put together largely by the Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, who has done a great job.", 
                "It is hard to figure why our colleagues oppose this. They have some distrust in the Federal Government. In this area we do too. We think the Federal Government is demanding too much money to repay loans. Why don't they join us?", 
                "The cost of tuition goes up and up, the cost to repay goes up and up, and the burden on the backs of so many goes up and up.", 
                "So all we want is a fair shot for everyone to be able to afford college and to be able to repay. This should have been a bipartisan bill; it is not right now, but maybe there will be a change of heart. I will tell my colleagues this: This will become law, maybe not today but in the next months and next year. It has become an issue in campaigns throughout the country. This is an issue that resonates with voters--Democratic, Independent, Republican, liberal, conservative, North, South, East, and West, and we will keep fighting until every American has a fair shot at affording college and repaying their loans.",

                "Senate Republicans simply cannot accept that simple notion that they should be paid the same for doing the exact same work. Senate Republicans believe it is fair for men to be paid more than women for doing the exact same thing. It is hard to comprehend, but that is obviously what they believe. On three separate occasions over the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have filibustered the Paycheck Fairness Act. They prevented a vote on this issue--this issue of basic fairness.", 
                "Today is a new opportunity for Senate Republicans to do what is right for America's working women and families. The Paycheck Fairness Act would help close a wage disparity by empowering women to negotiate for equal pay.", 
                "Shouldn't a woman be able to negotiate for equal pay?", 
                "This bill would also give workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination and bar retaliation against employees for discussing salary information. Shouldn't a woman be able to talk about wage disparity without fear of reprisal?", 
                "One of the first things we passed in the Obama administration was the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, and that is one reason we are doing this today. Lilly Ledbetter worked for many years doing the same work as men in her position. She learned she was being paid a lot less, but the U.S. Supreme Court said: Too bad--you should have discovered this a lot earlier. If she had discovered it earlier, she would have been fired. This bill would give workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination and bar retaliation against employees for discussing salary information. That is why we passed the Lilly Ledbetter legislation.", 
                "I repeat: Shouldn't a woman be able to talk about wage disparity without fear of reprisal?", 
                "This legislation would help secure adequate compensation for victims of gender-based pay discrimination. Shouldn't a woman be able to recoup wages that are illegally withheld? The answer, of course, is yes.", 
                "These are commonsense proposals that are supported by the vast majority of Americans. Why is there even a debate on the issue of equal pay? It is because Senate Republicans continue to stifle debate on this issue. They are filibustering yet another piece of important legislation.", 
                "Instead of doing what is right for working women and families and our economy, Republicans are saying: We will not even let the Senate vote on this issue.", 
                "Republicans say there really is no issue and the pay gap between men and women is exaggerated, and if there is one, it is OK. Republicans say that there are already strong Federal laws that prevent gender-based pay discrimination. I wish it were so. Some Republicans say--as one did here in the Senate last week--that equal pay for women is nothing more than a political show vote. But when all their excuses and explanations have been exhausted, their wives, their daughters, and their granddaughters are still making 77 cents for every dollar their male counterparts make for doing the exact same work--and that is not fair.", 
                "If Republicans will not stand up for the women in their homes and communities and all across this Nation, we Senate Democrats will.", 
                "American women deserve better. They deserve fair wages. They deserve a fair shot at providing for their families. American women deserve equality.", 
                "Would the Chair announce the business of the day."

                "Mr. President, in just a few minutes we are going to have a procedural vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act. If we truly believe women and men are equal and should be paid equally, this ought to be an overwhelming vote.", 
                "The Senate women held a press conference after the last vote. The Republicans gave the first procedural vote so we were able to get to this point, but now we have to have 60 votes in order to move forward with an actual vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act.", 
                "We all know what this vote is about. It is very simple. It is about women in America having the same opportunity for success as their male counterparts. No one should be paid less just for being a woman.", 
                "This issue was brought to us front and center by Lilly Ledbetter, who was a manager at a Goodyear tire plant in the South and who discovered just by happenstance that although there were five managers doing the same job--she and four men--she was getting considerably less money.", 
                "To make a long story short, the courts were stacked against her. At the end of the day, Lilly Ledbetter was told by the Supreme Court that she was too late--she didn't know about this; it took her a long time to know about it--therefore she had no case. We fixed that problem, and we said: No more. We are not going to put a statute of limitations because someone may never find out about this unfair situation for many years and they shouldn't be disqualified from justice.", 
                "But now we have more problems. We have testimony of people being harassed simply because they want to know whether they are getting paid fairly. I am so grateful to our colleague Senator Mikulski from Maryland for introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act which will help close the wage gap.", 
                "We may say: Is there truly a wage gap? Yes, there is. Women get paid 77 cents for every dollar made by a man for the same work. That is not every woman. But when we average it all, that is what she gets. In terms of a yearly pay, it is $11,000. I think we ought to look at this $11,000 less a year. What could we buy for $11,000? One year of groceries, in many places a year of rent, in many places a year of daycare or a used car or community college.", 
                "What does this mean? It means that because the woman is not getting paid fairly, her family suffers, whether in the quality of housing or their food or the quality of daycare, the quality of their car, and certainly the ability of that woman to get an education and move up the scale.", 
                "Looking at it from a yearly standpoint I think is important, but I asked my staff: Let's look at it over a lifetime and what is the loss to this woman and her family in a lifetime. Almost one-half million dollars--$443,000--in a woman's lifetime if she gets 77 cents instead of a full dollar. What could she do with that? She could pay off one or two mortgages for that, send three kids to the University of California or buy 8,000 tanks of gas. What we don't say here is you need more security, and economic security today, which is so critical. Thanks to science, we are living longer and we know it gets more expensive to live.", 
                "If I were to tell one of my Republican friends on the other side that somebody came up to a woman, knocked her on the head and took half a million dollars from her and stole it, they would be horrified and they would remedy it. They would bring in the law. Well, I am asking them to simply vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act. Just vote for it. Make sure women in this country earn what they deserve to earn.", 
                "The wage gap not only hurts our families, it hurts our economy. If you add it all up, it is $200 billion a year in income that would be spent at the grocery, that would be spent at the gas station, that would be spent on vacation, that would be spent on local restaurants or in better housing.", 
                "In the history of our Nation we have had a lot of fights before over the issue of discrimination. We know you cannot discriminate on pay because of race, disability, or age. What we are saying is you shouldn't be able to discriminate based on your gender. It is wrong. I would say if it were reversed, I would be standing here fighting for the men. It is not right. People have to be paid based on the work they do, and if the work they do is similar to the work of a man, as in the case of Lilly Ledbetter, they should be paid the same.", 
                "What the Mikulski legislation does is it prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee who shares information with their coworkers. Right now if you are around the cooler of your corporation and somebody says: Oh, my God, I cannot afford to get a babysitter for my child, I need a raise, and somebody says: Well, what do you make? And they say: I make X. Believe me, you can be fired for asking those questions. It is wrong. We have seen it happen. We want to make sure if there is a disparity in pay that it is warranted. Sure, if a woman is doing less than a man in a different job, of course that is not the same. We are saying if you do the same work, you have got to get paid the same.", 
                "We have hundreds of personal stories from all over this great Nation from people who have faced pay discrimination. I have many of these stories from California. One of them is a woman from my State who had an identical advanced degree as her husband, and she landed the exact job as her husband, but they were at different worksites. Her husband was offered $5,000 more in starting salary for the same job with the exact same resume--same job, the woman gets paid $5,000 less.", 
                "Then there is a health care worker in Long Island. She discovered she had been earning $10 an hour less than her colleagues with the exact experience. When she brought this up to her superiors, which you would expect her to do--you have got to fight for yourself. Don't we tell people that? Stand up, have respect, but ask the right questions. So she brought it up to her superiors. She was reprimanded. She was reprimanded and told not to discuss any type of wage gap.", 
                "Then there is a female employee from a major corporation in Florida. She was told when she was hired that if she disclosed her salary to other workers, that was grounds for dismissal. So you have somebody who is well trained. She is great. Then you are talking to your friends in the workplace, you mention your salary. She was told in advance that this is grounds for dismissal.", 
                "This bill is a major step in the right direction. I call on my Republican friends--we don't need many of you--five, is that right--six, if everyone is here. We need a handful. Stand with women, stand with families, stand for children, stand for equality, stand for justice, stand for what is right. Don't play games with this. Don't take the side of a boss who is exerting all kinds of pressure on a woman to tamp down her salary. I think clearly if we do this together tonight--and I always remain hopeful--if we do this together tonight, what we are going to see is an America that is fair, an America that is just when it comes to our women.", 
                "I am really glad one of our colleagues is here to discuss this from her perspective. You know, my kids would say to me, ``Mom, this is a no-brainer.''", 
                "This is not complicated, equal pay for equal work. We stand for that as Democrats, and we are going to keep on fighting for it. Tonight is that moment in time when we will see whether our Republican friends stand with us to give a fair shot to the women in this country--a fair shot--or they will block us as they have done before. I hope maybe they will see the light tonight. I don't think anything I have said will influence them, but I hope it might, because I do think it is in their interests as well as the interests of the women in this Nation to stand united with the Democrats on this: equal pay for equal work, fairness and justice to the women in this Nation. They deserve it.",

People deserve a fair working wage. That is why we need to raise the minimum wage. Equal work should get equal pay, and that is why we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.", 
                "I wish to thank the dean of the Senate women, Senator Barbara Mikulski, for leading this effort for equal pay for equal work in the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and keeping the focus on the need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.", 
                "In 2009, we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make sure that workers who face pay discrimination based on gender, race, age, disability, religion, or national origin have access to the courts. In doing so we restored the original intent of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act. Now it is time to prevent that pay discrimination from happening in the first place.", 
                "Women have made big strides in this economy. Women are getting advanced degrees. They are starting new businesses. They are leading major corporations. The Fortune 500 now has 24 women CEOs. Twenty-four out of five hundred there is still a lot of work to do, but that is so much better than where we were decades ago. Now we have a record 20 women in the Senate. Yet despite the progress we have made and all the gaps we have closed, women still make less money than men do.", 
                "The pay gap has real consequences for American families in our entire economy. Two-thirds of today's families rely on the mother's income entirely or in part, and in more than one-third of families the mother is the main breadwinner. But women only earn more than men in exactly 7 of the 534 occupations listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is only seven occupations, and I know there is disagreement about what the pay disparity is, if it is just based on other factors. But the truth is when you look at the list of the occupations, in only seven do women make more than men.", 
                "As Senate Chair of the Joint Economic Committee, I released a report showing how this pay disparity affects women's financial security, because I think a lot of times people are very focused on the here and now, what that means the wage differential, and what that means in the workplace. This report shows that lower wages impact women all throughout their working lives, and these lower lifetime earnings translate into less security and retirement.", 
                "You have the fact that women live longer but yet they have less money to begin with. Women live longer than men on average and are more likely to spend part of their retirement on their own because they live longer. So women actually need to have more money for their years in retirement. According to our report, the average annual income--this is average annual income for women aged 65 and older--is about $11,000 less than it is for men. That is $11,000 less each year to buy groceries, to pay heating bills, to be able to see grandchildren.", 
                "Lower lifetime earnings result in lower retirement benefits. Retirement security is often described as the three-legged stool--Social Security, pension benefits, and personal savings. A woman's Social Security check is 78 percent of a man's check on average. Those are the facts. Again, it is about 80 percent of that of a man. The median income from company or union pension for women is 53 percent lower than for men. Finally, lower earnings also affect the ability of women to contribute to their own retirement plan. Women have less income to put aside and are less able to save money for their own retirement. They have smaller paychecks, they have smaller Social Security checks, smaller pension checks, and less savings in their retirement plans. They live longer and they worry all the time that they are going to outlive their savings. All this contributes to less retirement security.", 
                "The pay gap is an especially large burden on women in the sandwich generation, juggling jobs, juggling their kids, and looking out for their aging parents at the same time. When two-thirds of the caregivers for aging parents are women, we need to make sure they have financial security.", 
                "So make no mistake, the pay gap impacts women. But my point today is that it impacts women through the entire arc of their lives, and, if anything, it impacts older women who for now decades have been making less money in an even greater way than it impacts them when they are younger.", 
                "Around 70 percent of our economy is consumer-based. If we don't have fair pay, if we don't have enough pay for middle-income families, then they are not going to buy things whether they are younger or older. That is yet another argument for not only having adequate minimum wages but also for addressing this pay gap. This legislation builds on the promises of the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and gives women new tools and protections they need to guard against pay discrimination.", 
                "I want to get this done, but I also want to work on the issue of long-term savings and how we can make it easier for women and men to save their money when they are working at jobs so they can help themselves. As we move forward, as we are living longer--which is great--we know it is going to get harder and harder.", 
                "It was the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota who famously said, ``We all do better when we all do better.'' I still believe that is true, and so do my colleagues who have joined me today.

All we wanted to do was bring up the bill to debate it, to amend it, and then vote on final passage. We could not get cloture on the filibuster. Those are wonky parliamentary words that said we could have unlimited debate.", 
                "If we had gotten cloture under our rules, that would have been 30 hours of debate. I think that is enough time.

You can't discuss your wages with the person next to you. So if a woman was trying to figure out what the guy next to her was making, and he wanted to tell her--men of quality always support us women as we seek equality. If he wanted to tell her, both could have been fired--her for asking and him for telling. We wanted to close that loophole.",

                "Mr. President, we gather here today in this remarkable place--a symbol of freedom and democracy for the whole world--to remember the tragic, horrific, unspeakable attacks of September 11, 2001, and we remember the innocent lives that were lost, the people of many different ages who worked to help the injured, brave heroes who have fought terrorism and extremism around the globe in the years since 9/11, and, of course, the victims themselves, many of them from Connecticut. This day has special meaning in Connecticut because it affects so directly and sadly the loved ones and families of people who sacrificed their lives as a result of that unimaginably cruel and brutal terrorist act. We remember them with pride. We remember their grace, civility, humanity, dedication to the public good, and their love for their families.", 
                "We have been striving since that terrible day to strengthen our Nation, to live proudly and unashamedly, consistently with our national values of peace, tolerance, and service. This effort requires commitment and sacrifice. It has required service at home and abroad from countless men and women who have served in uniform--our police, our firefighters, our first responders--believing that the best way we can honor the men and women who died on that day is to make America the best place it can possibly be. It is the greatest and strongest Nation in the history of the world, and it is so because people have always believed it can be made better, freer, stronger, braver. And that is what we have tried to do.", 
                "Today in the Senate, in the Committee on the Judiciary, I was proud to cosponsor and vote for a measure that will give those victims and their families some additional justice. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will hold foreign sponsors of terrorism that target America accountable in U.S. courts.", 
                "Obstacles have been raised in our Federal courts, obstacles on procedural grounds and technical issues, most recently in a Second Circuit case, In re Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, which, in my view, misread Federal law to provide immunity to the Saudi Government and entities that claim to be associated with the Saudi Government against the 9/11 victims' claims alleging its support for those attacks.", 
                "This new legislation will make clear that terrorism is unsupportable and must be held accountable in our U.S. courts. It will erase the immunity and the procedural obstacles that can be raised and make sure that sovereign immunity as a doctrine provides no safe harbor, no haven for terrorism when victims and their families seek to hold those terrorist sponsors as well as terrorist groups accountable for their horrific actions.", 
                "That measure was passed with the tremendous leadership and support of its two main cosponsors, Senators Cornyn and Schumer. I thank them for their work, as well as our chairman, Senator Leahy, and ranking member, Senator Grassley, for their willingness to move this matter on September 11, and say to the victims and their loved ones: We will hold accountable the wrongdoers, and we will make sure the courts of the United States are places where justice is provided against terrorism.", 
                "We can also make America a better place by giving more Americans a fair shot. A fair shot is what America promises to men and women who live here now and men and women who come here. A fair shot is part of our basic principled existence. The terrorists struck the World Trade Center and they hit the Pentagon, but they missed America. What makes America great is those principled values.", 
                "As we gather today, we should say thank you to the brave men and women in uniform. The Acting President pro tempore is one of them, and I thank him. I thank my two sons who have served, one in the Marine Corps Reserve, deployed to Afghanistan, another now in the Navy. The fact is that the burden of this longest war in our history has been borne by less than 1 percent of our population. We owe all of them and their families our thanks, and we can best say thanks by giving them and all Americans a fair shot at the American dream.", 
                "I have just returned from 5 weeks in Connecticut, where I had the opportunity to listen to concerns of my constituents. The people of Connecticut are proud of this country, but they are also concerned about the great disparities that exist. No one is looking for a free lunch. Nobody in Connecticut thinks there is a free lunch. But people believe in a fair shot and the chance to make a better life for themselves and their families. The present disparities are stark and dispiriting and daunting and, at the end of the day, unacceptable and deeply disturbing.", 
                "Our country has made important strides toward recovering from the economic crisis of 2008, but we are far from done. We are still very much a work in progress economically and socially. Unfortunately, as the Federal Reserve noted just last week, economic burdens continue to fall hardest on Americans who can least afford them.", 
                "The disparities in this country have a particularly severe effect on women. Today women make up 50 percent of college graduates, but in order to do so they take on an average $30,000 in debt, and they go on to work at places where they earn only 77 cents or 82 cents for every $1 paid to men.", 
                "When women are treated fairly, we are all treated fairly. When women are treated unfairly, we all suffer. When college graduates struggle under crushing loads of debt, our whole economy suffers and we are all poorer. These problems affect real people. There are real, attainable solutions available to us all.", 
                "I have participated in more than a dozen roundtables across the State of Connecticut, roundtables at colleges and universities where I have heard story after story from them--and also roundtables in high schools--about their struggles to stay on top of their debt. They understood, every one of them, that they were taking on a significant burden but not one that is insurmountable, not one that will cripple them financially for the rest of their lives.", 
                "I heard from Gillon, an honorably discharged Army veteran who is now studying law. He wrote to me to say:", 
                "Despite having done everything that society tells us while growing up is the right thing to do, I'm still saddled with over $132,000 in federal school loan debt. My total monthly payments amount to nearly a third of my take-home salary each month, with no end in sight.", 
                "Dean, who has three children, earned a master's degree to try to move ahead in his career. A year after graduating, he is $55,000 in debt, and he is struggling to support his family even though he and his wife work four jobs between them--four jobs and he is struggling to make ends meet, to put a roof over his family's head.", 
                "Along with my friend and colleague Senator Murphy, I met last week with Susan Herbst, the president of the University of Connecticut, and with a number of UConn students and recent graduates, on the campus. They shared with me how excited they are about the vast and limitless opportunities afforded them by this great university.", 
                "I sensed the excitement while I was there of this great campus, making me envious for the time they are spending there in studying and exploring the tremendous reaches of human knowledge, both practical and theoretical, and yet the difficulty of how affording a college education has constrained and constricted the professional climate beyond that campus. As heady and glorious as the days on campus may be, there is an overhang of doubt and debt that restricts the reach of their lives. It restricts the reach of our economy because it constricts consumer demand, it restricts the reach of their ambitions to start businesses, and families to buy homes, and to move ahead with their lives. And that is a problem for all of us.", 
                "There are ways for Congress to address this problem. We can pass the legislation I am pleased to cosponsor with Senator Warren of Massachusetts which would allow borrowers to refinance student loan debt. We can pass Senator Franken's legislation to ensure that debt obligations are explained in clear, comprehensible terms so students know what they are taking on. I am developing a proposal to improve the flexibility of loan forgiveness for students who pursue careers in public service such as teaching, public safety, or firefighting.", 
                "The current program requires students to work a full 10 years in these professions for any debt forgiveness. Any debt forgiveness hinges on those full 10 years. I believe shorter periods of work should allow for loan forgiveness in proportion to the time they spend on the job. There are ways to make public service a quicker and easier means for loan forgiveness.", 
                "There are other methods as well that we should pursue to enable college affordability. Paycheck fairness is basic to America. There is no reason that American women make only 77 cents per every dollar made by men. Male health care workers in Connecticut earn on average almost twice as much as women performing the same job. Men working in finance earn 61 percent more than women with the same position.", 
                "This shocking gap persists when controlled for education, experience, and other job-related factors. The data demonstrates unavoidably and inescapably that women make less than men in 97 percent of professions.", 
                "The event I attended in Connecticut, which was a meeting of the Connecticut Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, chaired by Antonia Moran, highlighted the shameful lag in women's compensation. Many women with college degrees told me about their personal struggles.", 
                "Lori Pelletier, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, explained how carefully crafted union contracts can often make a difference, but everyone agreed that better laws to address the problem are needed.", 
                "Fortunately, my distinguished colleague Senator Mikulski, who is here on the floor today, has introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act. It will bring into the 21st century, more than 50 years after the Equal Pay Act was signed by President Kennedy, the gap of full equality. It will improve the remedies available to victims of discrimination. It will prohibit employers from punishing workers who share salary information. It will require any differences in pay to be determined only by job-related factors. It will improve training and education regarding how to take action against discrimination.", 
                "Pay equity is good for families, it is good for the economy, it is good for America, and it is a matter of fundamental fairness. I thank my colleague Senator Mikulski for her great work on this issue. I am proud to stand here with her today and with so many other colleagues, because it is basic to a fair shot in the United States of America.", 
                "I know American people are counting on all of us to help make America better, to keep faith with the great men and women who have served in our military around the world, who have served and sacrificed--the loved ones of 9/11 victims, of all the victims of terrorism who have perished since and before 9/11. To make America better is what we can do to keep faith with them. To give Americans a fair shot should be our mission today and every day. Mr. President, I yield the floor."

                "Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, for his words on what the middle class is facing and his particular advocacy on behalf of women. It is well known and much appreciated.", 
                "I come to the floor today to talk about middle-class people who are trying to play by the rules. But before I do, on this auspicious day, September 11, 2014, I wish to pay my respects once again and express my heartfelt sympathy to the families of people who died on September 11 throughout this country--at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, in Pennsylvania--to the wonderful first responders who risked their lives and many themselves who perished, to those who were wounded or sick and bear the permanent burden of their response to that awful tragedy, and to the families of the loved ones who have to live with it every single day--who have an absent chair at Christmas or Thanksgiving, or Hanukkah, whatever faith holiday where families gather and remember.", 
                "The Nation cannot forget what happened that day and it cannot forget why it happened, and we cannot forget the people who were there and paid this terrible price of terrorism.", 
                "I express my sympathy, my condolences, to say one way we can honor them is to make sure we don't have another terrorist attack in the United States. But what they were doing that day is to believe in America, and that brings me to what I want to talk about today.", 
                "Yes, people talk about when we are out on our break we are on vacation. But I have been moving around Maryland, and one of the things I see and hear that is so clear is that, No. 1, the middle class is worried whether it is going to stay middle class. Those who want to be middle class worry if there is going to be an opportunity ladder for them to achieve middle-class status, where they can earn a decent living, raise a family, and make a contribution to their community.", 
                "They are repeatedly told: If you work hard and go by the rules, you will do OK. They are becoming increasingly skeptical of that, because they feel the very rules of government work against them and the very climate of government stops any change to be able to help them. They either feel that we are irrelevant or we are working against them.", 
                "That is why they say: All we want is for America to be America again, where if you work hard, go by the rules, you can have a pretty good life and make a pretty good contribution to this great country of ours.", 
                "So when they talk about these issues and if you talk to the old-timers--particularly those who are facing families in long-term care--they worry about the very cruel rules of government that tell them to spend down their life savings until they are eligible for Medicaid; that if you worked hard and you saved, you are actually penalized for that--except for legislation I passed 25 years ago--that if they had gone and squandered their money, they would be better off and more eligible.", 
                "Then there are the young people who want to be able to go to school where they can make something of themselves and make America a better place to live.", 
                "I held student roundtables, along with my colleague Senator Cardin. People talked to us about the careers they wanted. At Bowie State, four of the young people who were part of the roundtable want to go into nursing, both men as well as women. They think: I could help people. We have a nursing shortage in this country. Yet the very obstacle to them being able to afford to pay for their education will prohibit it.", 
                "Why is it that education is so expensive in this country when we look at tuition, books, fees? And then what is it that we do? First of all, we make sure that Pell grants aren't year-long. You can only go two semesters. But if you want to go during the summer to ace that class that you have to do for compliance purposes for graduation, or that especially hard class--you only want to take one class a semester--your government won't help you finish sooner or finish better. We won't help you. We can give tax break earmarks, but we can't give tax breaks or help there.", 
                "Then when they look at their student debt and the interest rates they carry, they ask me: Senator Mikulski, why is it that you can refinance a yacht but I can't refinance my student loan?", 
                "And I say: Well, you know, we are stuck on the motion to proceed, and we are two votes short of the filibuster; but then we will go backward if we do this.", 
                "They don't want to hear this parliamentary wonky stuff. What they want to hear is: We believe in them and we need them and we want them, and we are going to help them for what they believe we are going to help them achieve to be able to get a student loan. But underneath it all is that work should be worth it and work should be rewarded.", 
                "That brings me then to paycheck fairness. One of the other rules they feel is against them is: The rules are rigged against you if you want to fight for equal pay for equal work. If you want to fight for equal pay for equal work, you can be retaliated against, you can be humiliated, you can be harassed, you can be fired, simply because you are asking the person standing next to you at the water cooler or the computer printout machine: How much do you make? That simple question, how much do you make, can trigger a whole retaliatory effort against you. That is the rule, and all it is you want to know is what kind of dough the person next to you is making. This is why we once again are bringing up the Paycheck Fairness Act.", 
                "The Paycheck Fairness Act is to fill and close the loopholes that came about in the original Equal Pay Act. We have been at this for 50 years. When this fight started under Lyndon Johnson, women made almost 50 cents for every dollar men made--and after 50 years, gee, we are up to 77 cents per every dollar. And for Latino women, African-American women, other women of color, it is even worse.", 
                "People might say: Didn't you fix this when you did the Lilly Ledbetter bill? The Lilly Ledbetter bill that we did pass restored the law to where it was before the Supreme Court decision. This updates and strengthens it. What it does is it deals with this whole issue of retaliation. The Lilly Ledbetter bill did not address employers who are currently able to legally retaliate against workers who share salary information. This legislation stops employers from being able to sue or punish workers for comparing wages.", 
                "It also helps restore congressional intent. It makes sure that employers who claim that differences in pay based on any factor other than sex are dealt with. This legislation limits employers' ability to exploit this loophole by requiring that this defense can only be used when it is related to job performance and is necessary for business.", 
                "This bill creates a fair playing field, simply knowing what the next person earns and being able to work and to negotiate for equal pay for equal work. The Paycheck Fairness Act fixes the law to keep discrimination from happening. It would have helped keep Lilly from having to sue in the first place.", 
                "This bill puts an end to the incentives that cause employers to think that paying women less is just a cost of doing business. It gets rid of the secrecy that makes it harder to uncover pay differences. Why should pay be such a secret unless you are ashamed to say what it is? Why would you want to keep it a secret? Maybe it is because you don't want to brag that you pay the men more than the women. Maybe you are too ashamed. Maybe you think it will lead you to an EEOC lawsuit. We want to end secrecy at the job place, where you know what the person next to you makes--you have a right to ask.", 
                "I have heard from women all over America and I have heard from men--men who work so hard, particularly for their daughters; men who have jobs they hate so their girls can go to school and have jobs they love. Men want equal pay for equal work. They want it for their spouses, they want it for their widowed mothers, and they want it for their daughters.", 
                "Listening to the cases--Donna Smith of Maryland's Eastern Shore worked as a retail clerk. She was told not to discuss her pay, but when she found out she was being paid less than a male cook and was doing the exact same job, she filed an EEOC complaint. And what happened? While she fought for her pay, they were fighting her with agitation and humiliation.", 
                "Latoya Weaver sent a letter to me. She is a single parent with three children, working in guest services at a hotel. She found out her pay of $8 an hour was $2 less than the males doing the same job. Two dollars when you are at bare minimum makes a pretty big difference. She filed an EEOC lawsuit. Although she only received compensatory damage because of the discrimination, the company's policy against discussing pay means it could happen again.", 
                "I could give example after example. I have been talking about this for a number of years. It is time. In the Senate, after all is said and done, more gets said than gets done. But this time, in the next 72 hours, we could actually vote to move the bill to the floor, to continue the debate and discussion and actually right the wrongs in equal pay for equal work. This is why American women want a fair shot. All they want is to be paid exactly the same--equal pay--as their male counterparts.", 
                "Mr. President, knowing of your own steadfast advocacy for the middle class in this country and an opportunity ladder in this country, we have to stop and make sure the rules government creates do not rig the game against people who are working hard and trying to play by the rules. The rules should work for the people and not for the government or for those who want to hold down wages or opportunities.", 
                "We are not going to accept women being paid less. We have paid attention to this problem, we've listened to the voices of the people, and we have a solution in the Paycheck Fairness Act. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see if there are amendments, whatever we could do to move this process forward. I would love a unanimous vote out of the Senate to have paycheck fairness finally in our lawbooks and in women's checkbooks. It's time to end pay inequity. It's time for Congress to act.", 
                "Mr. President, I yield the floor."

                "When the Supreme Court issued its ruling in McCutcheon several months ago, it was another step on the path towards destruction of our system of campaign finance laws. First in Citizens United and then in McCutcheon, the Supreme Court has been chipping away at the actual foundation of our democracy that everyone is equal in the political arena.

This year, the amount of independent expenditures from a small number of individuals will exceed the money spent by all the others. It is just amazing. We cannot have it. That is why Democrats will continue to fight for a constitutional amendment that would finally allow us to fight back and regulate the dark money that is flooding our elections and threatening to take us back to the era of the robber barons. The Federal Government and the States should be allowed to pass laws that prevent unregulated sums of undisclosed money from pervading our elections.", 
                "This constitutional amendment would do just that. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not see it that way. They have argued that the amendment would curtail freedom of speech. The Republican leader said in an op-ed earlier this week that Democrats are trying to take an eraser to the First Amendment.",

All Democrats are trying to erase is the hundreds of millions dollars--undisclosed--that are tainting our elections, whether they are coming from the Koch brothers or George Soros or Tom Steyer. All of them should not be allowed to have such huge influence.", 
                "Many other Republicans have portrayed this sensible amendment as an unparalleled attack on the First Amendment, which, they seem to argue, is absolute. I would say, for instance, to the Senator from Texas and my Republican friends that no amendment is absolute.", 
                "You cannot yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Child pornography is illegal. We have libel laws. These are all sensible limits to the First Amendment.", 
                "This amendment is similarly a sensible amendment. It creates balance. Every amendment--and the Founding Fathers, when they created the Bill of Rights, and the States, when they ratified them, realized that ``balance'' is a watchword. We believe in the right to buy arms, but people shouldn't be allowed to buy a tank and ride down the street in it. We believe in all of the amendments, but none should be stretched to ridiculous extremes, which any law can be.", 
                "This amendment would go a long way to restoring fairness and credibility to a system of campaign laws that the Supreme Court has ripped to shreds over the past years.", 
                "I don't know if these Supreme Court Justices know the harm they are doing to our system in their abstract view that limiting many kinds of campaign finance violates the First Amendment, but I wish they could be on the ground and see the harm they are doing.", 
                "Simply put, unregulated dark money is poisoning our elections, and this amendment is the antidote. The American people want us to change the way elections are financed in this country not just for the sake of the system itself but because the current system results in a Congress that fails to do what average folks--the middle class--want it to do. Democrats want to raise the minimum wage, but the Koch brothers spend millions electing candidates who oppose it. Democrats want equal pay for equal work, but shadowy billionaires and corporate interests funnel millions to the campaigns of candidates who would block it.", 
                "We have to have fair elections in order to give the middle class a fair shot. And on the amendment the Presiding Officer has so valiantly sponsored, all we want to say is if you are a multimillionaire, you ought to pay taxes at the same rate as everyone else and use the money we gain to help make it easier for everyone to afford college and pay their college debts at a reasonable interest rate after they get out of college. But those who would be the small number who would be hurt by this have a few clarion voices who have billions of dollars who spend the money and prevent candidates who believe in this view--which most Americans believe in--from getting elected.", 
                "We have to have fair elections in order to give the middle class a fair shot. We hope our Republican colleagues will drop their objections and work with us to restore some semblance of fairness to our electoral system.",

                "Madam President, I know that in just offering the amendment I sought to offer on the Senate floor I have received an objection. Let me briefly describe what I am trying to offer. The objection that I just received from the other side of the aisle is a demonstration of what is wrong in the Senate right now.", 
                "What is happening in the Senate right now is the majority leader keeps bringing legislation to the floor, and people are not allowed to offer amendments that directly pertain to the legislation.", 
                "In fact, right now pending on the Senate floor is the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act. I have an amendment I want to offer on the Senate floor to that act that deals with addressing pay discrimination, but I am not going to be allowed to offer that amendment.", 
                "I guess the first question we have to ask is: Why is that? Why is it that when we have such an important issue, which I acknowledge is an important issue--that people in this country be treated fairly, that we be paid solely based on our experience and qualifications, that we eliminate discrimination in the workplace; something I would hope we could work together on and about which we could have a real debate on this Senate floor--if someone comes to the floor and offers an amendment, what we get is an objection, because, really, what we are doing right now on the floor--let's be clear about it--is a political charade. It is trying to score political points on an issue that is very important that we shouldn't be sitting here trying to score political points on.", 
                "Why can't both sides of the aisle offer their amendments on ideas on how to eliminate discrimination in the workplace? It seems to me that if they are serious about the issue, the majority leader would allow individuals like me and other Senators on both sides of the aisle to come to the floor and offer their amendments. But we have just seen that when I have done that, I got an objection instead of allowing my amendment to be debated fully on this floor.", 
                "All Americans should be treated fairly and paid solely based on their experience and qualifications, and discrimination has no place in the American workforce.", 
                "There are important laws we have passed on a bipartisan basis in the Congress. Laws like the Equal Pay Act and title VII of the Civil Rights Act are there to combat workplace discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became the first Federal law designed to protect U.S. workers from employment discrimination based upon a person's sex.", 
                "The Equal Pay Act of 1963 requires employers to pay female employees the same wages that they pay male employees for equal work--very important laws.", 
                "Both title VII and the Equal Pay Act provide a way for those who are discriminated against to file complaints against their employers and pursue financial remedies if they are discriminated against in the workplace. Our focus, of course, always needs to be on enforcing those important laws that were passed by the Congress to ensure that both men and women in the workplace will be judged based on their performance and not based on their gender.", 
                "Unfortunately, despite these laws there are instances where pay discrimination still exists. With 60 percent of women serving as the primary earners in their households, this disparity must be addressed, and this is an important issue. But the so-called Paycheck Fairness Act that is pending on the floor, in my view, is not the answer. Instead of ensuring that women are treated fairly, the Paycheck Fairness Act would limit the ability of women in some instances to have flexible work schedules if that is what they need, and it would make it easier--much easier--to file frivolous lawsuits that, frankly, are a boon to trial lawyers. One concern I have about the bill pending on the floor--and I think it is a legitimate concern--is that it could have an impact on reducing the ability of employers to award merit pay.", 
                "I had the privilege of serving as the first woman attorney general in New Hampshire, and before that I worked in private practice in a law firm. In my position and in the work I have done throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to meet incredible women in all fields in New Hampshire and throughout this country, whether it is leaders in the health sector, in the business sector--women working very hard every day in this country. There are many instances, I have to tell you, where women, based on merit, have outperformed their male colleagues. So what we don't want to do is create a law and pass a law that actually reduces the opportunities for employers in the workplace to reward merit, because women--like men--want the opportunity to earn more than their male counterparts when we do a better job.", 
                "We had this debate last April on the Senate floor, and when we had this debate on the Senate floor we experienced what we are experiencing right now. Paycheck fairness was brought to the floor and, in fact, I worked on an amendment with some of my colleagues--Senator Fischer, Senator Collins, and Senator Murkowski. We offered an amendment that we thought would help address the discrimination that can occur in the workplace and to address retaliation when employees discuss the salaries they make so that they can become informed in the workplace. But when we offered that amendment in April, we were denied a vote on it. We were in the same situation we are now.", 
                "So it is like ``Groundhog Day.'' The Senate rejected the bill pending in April, and we were denied all amendments and the ability to really debate and amend it and have a real discussion about this important issue. Here we are again leading into the November elections, and again the bill is on the floor, and again Senators like me who have offered an amendment that I hoped we could discuss and consider are going to be denied the ability to do so.", 
                "When I came to this floor in April, when this bill was pending on the Senate floor before, I said then and I firmly believe it now: If the majority leader believes this is an important issue, then we should have a real debate and an open amendment process and not engage in a political charade. I think the American people deserve better.", 
                "In New Hampshire, Republicans and Democrats actually got together and they were able to pass a bipartisan pay equity law which was signed into law in July. It is a commonsense measure that helps address wage disparities between men and women, and that law was the basis for the proposed amendment which I have just tried to offer on the Senate floor so that the Senate could consider some of the very good ideas that were worked through on a bipartisan basis in my State as a way to address discrimination in the workforce.", 
                "This amendment that I have filed--but that I am not being permitted to offer--is modeled on New Hampshire's law and, again, it was bipartisan. In fact, the amendment that I have offered is called the Ensuring Fairness in Pay Act. It would make clear that employers have to pay men and women equal wages for equal work. It ensures equal pay for workers performing equal work under similar conditions regardless of sex. In fact, it also prohibits retaliation against employees who discuss their pay information and prohibits employers from requiring employees to sign a contract or a waiver that prohibits the employees from disclosing their pay. This would allow employees to know what their situation is so they can ensure that they are being treated fairly.", 
                "What was passed in New Hampshire--my amendment here--also contains teeth. In fact, similar to New Hampshire's law, my amendment would impose a $2,500 penalty for any violation of this law and for pay discrimination. So putting teeth in it is important as well. We did that at the State level, and I thought we should consider doing this at the Federal level if my amendment could be considered by this body.", 
                "It also requires employers to post a notice that sets forth excerpts or summaries of the pertinent provisions of what is the law--title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--and information pertinent to how you file a complaint if you feel you are subject to discrimination in the workforce.", 
                "Finally, my amendment encourages States to provide pay disparity statistics including historical analysis and any information that would help the public understand and address this issue.", 
                "I urge the majority leader to put politics aside so that we can work together on a bipartisan solution, just as New Hampshire was able to do. In my home State of New Hampshire, when there is an amendment offered, you actually will get a vote on it. I think we are doing a real disservice to the American people, regardless of what the issue is, that Senators on both sides of the aisle when they are offering an amendment aren't permitted to have a vote on it on the Senate floor.", 
                "I yield the floor."

When you look at the exact breakout of who it is, 90 percent are over 20 years old, and more than half of them are older than 25 years old.", 
                "You are not talking about a teenager living at home. You are talking about people who are living independently in the community, trying to get by on $7.35 an hour or close to $15,000 a year, in a job that often has no benefits--health benefits, pension, et cetera.", 
                "Fifty-five percent of the people on minimum wage are working full time. Forty-four percent have some type of college education, an associate degree or bachelor's degree or other higher education. That is the reality of the minimum wage worker in this country. It is not the myth of a teenager living at home, looking for some pocket money.", 
                "These are hardworking people trying to get by, often on two or three jobs, without the benefits. Without that ability, if they miss their rent, they get evicted, and then they are homeless. As Mr. Rangel said, these are some of the same people that then show up on our health plans that States provide for being low-income.",

What have they done to help people who are aspiring to be in the minimum class? What have we got done in Congress?", 
                "There was a Congress in 1948 that was called the do-nothing Congress because they got so little done. The first year of that session, they passed 350 bills. Last year, this body passed 88.",

They are about whether or not you are fighting for the middle class and those who aspire to be in the middle class or whether you are here trying to help out the special interests and the lobbyists who represent the special interests. It is really that simple.", 
                "So we need to pass a raise for the American people. That means you pass an increase in the minimum wage. As other Members have said, it will lift so many people out of poverty and give a raise to so many people to help stimulate the economy.", 
                "So the Progressive Caucus is fighting each and every single day while we are here for a variety of issues: raising the minimum wage, trying to stop wage theft in this country, trying to extend unemployment insurance so that everyone who is out of work can still get some benefits while they are looking for work so that they can get that job. We all know the best social program is a job, and we want to make sure that everyone can get that job.", 
                "We need to continue to do the things that Congress needs to get done and we have not gotten done. So the minimum wage is one issue that we wanted to talk about today.", 
                "As we have the President speaking to us this evening, we want to make sure that this body has a very full and rich debate. As we passed in a bipartisan way, 370-40, we need to have a real debate and have real questions answered before we get involved, so that we never again have what happened the last time we got involved in Iraq because we are back again. There was no ``mission accomplished.'' A banner and a fly-in in military gear is not a successful end to an involvement.",

                "Madam President, I rise to express my strong frustration--and the frustration of Nebraskans--with the Senate's current debate.", 
                "Similar to many of my colleagues, I spent the past 5 weeks traveling my State and meeting with constituents. I held over one dozen listening sessions in communities all across Nebraska. Not a single Nebraskan told me to go back to Washington and vote to limit free speech. Not a single Nebraskan told me to come and play politics or take show votes.", 
                "The message I received from almost every Nebraskan was the same: Get something done, turn the economy around, deal with overregulation, help control the costs of health care, and help businesses create jobs. Prevailing concern with the economy and weak job growth exists all across our country. According to several leading economists, 225,000 jobs were supposed to be created last month. Instead, the number of jobs created was just 142,000. The real unemployment rate--those who are unemployed or underemployed--remains unacceptably high at nearly 12 percent. That is 19 million Americans who are out of work or want to work more hours.", 
                "It is a disgrace the Senate is not debating policies that will help them. Instead, we are debating a bill to limit free speech. It is no wonder the American people have such a poor opinion of Congress. Seriously, what are we doing here? In Washington, those in power are more concerned with winning elections so they can stay in power than with actually governing and making tough decisions that will protect our country and help our families, and that is what we are doing today with another show vote, another sound bite that is engineered by campaign strategists who don't have any interest in sound policy.", 
                "I wish to address the two proposals before the Senate this week--a resolution to amend the Bill of Rights and campaign legislation that is targeting women voters. The resolution offered by the Senator from New Mexico is, I believe, a clear attack on the First Amendment and a series of recent Supreme Court rulings. The measure grants unlimited authority to Congress and State legislatures to criminalize speech on any platform, and that includes the Internet.", 
                "This proposal guts the First Amendment and the principles of free speech that have endured since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. It further empowers incumbent politicians to make decisions with less accountability, and it muffles the voices of private citizens. It is perverse that the Senate is actually devoting time to debating the constitutional amendment that would actually diminish democratic participation and decrease freedom.", 
                "What have we become?", 
                "In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the ACLU wrote that the proposed amendment ``would severely limit the First Amendment, lead directly to government censorship of political speech and result in a host of unintended consequences that would undermine the goals the amendment has been introduced to advance--namely encouraging vigorous political dissent and providing voice to the voiceless, which we, of course, support.''", 
                "The ACLU is not exactly an ally of the Republican Party, but their letter shows there is broad concern over this poorly crafted resolution.", 
                "I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand for free speech, to stand for democratic participation, and to reject this resolution.", 
                "At this time I wish to address the issue of equal pay and the paycheck fairness legislation. Make no mistake, some women in this country continue to struggle with gender-based pay discrimination. Equal pay for equal work is a principle I strongly support. With 60 percent of women working as primary breadwinners, lost wages hurt families and single women alike. Republicans fully agree that gender-based pay discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable.", 
                "In April I worked with Senator Collins, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Murkowski on a reasonable proposal to modernize key portions of the 51-year-old Equal Pay Act. Our proposal prevents retaliation against employees who inquire about, discuss or disclose their salaries. In fact, one of the President's April Executive orders also deals with nonretaliation, suggesting this is an area we can agree and work together.", 
                "Our proposal also reinforces current law which prohibits pay discrimination based on gender and it requires employers to notify employees of their rights.", 
                "Finally, it addresses the opportunity gap or the need to provide both men and women with good-paying jobs. It consolidates duplicative job training programs and provides Federal grants to States for the creation of industry-led partnerships. This program is meant to provide women and men underrepresented in industries that report worker shortages with the skills they need to compete.", 
                "I believe this proposal could pass the Senate. It is reasonable, it is targeted, and it is a serious solution. Instead, we have a Senate that is laser focused on election-year politics, bills that no Republican can support, and bills that even some Democrats reject.", 
                "The majority leader does not appear to have any interest in putting bills on the floor that can pass--bills we can work on together. That idea doesn't fit into that election-year playbook. At the end of the day, this is raw politics. That is all it is. Nebraskans expect more. Americans expect more. They expect us to do our jobs, to work together to offer solutions, to debate, to amend, and to vote.", 
                "There are so many proposals I would love to vote on. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but we should be voting. We have to start having meaningful debate. We have to start taking votes, and they better be real votes. That is the only way we are going to do our jobs, and that is the only way we will be held accountable by our constituents. We should be tackling those very important issues we spoke to our neighbors and friends about when we were at home traveling our States during the August recess.", 
                "Enough with the sound bites, enough with the show votes, enough speaking to cameras. Let's listen to the American people. Let's get back to the Senate we all admired when we were in school and read about in our country's history. As students we studied those serious--and many times very heated--debates that took place on this floor.", 
                "As Senators we may not always agree on what is the best policy, but we better start doing our jobs. We need to return to debating real policy that addresses the very real needs of the American people.", 
                "I thank the Presiding Officer.",

                "Madam President, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, as one of our great leaders on our economic agenda, of what we are calling a fair shot, it is incredibly important in the time we are in session that we have an opportunity to vote again on each of those items and hopefully pass each of the items at the front line of what American families, American people, care about in terms of lifting their standard of living and creating more opportunities.", 
                "It is great that we have seen the stock market more than double in the past 5, 6 years. It is great that someone who is living off of interest earnings has a better portfolio. That is great.", 
                "But the person who is getting up every day, going to work, and maybe takes a shower after work, ought to have the same fair shot to get ahead so that this economy is growing--and that is great--but it needs to grow and create opportunity for everyone.", 
                "We can help with that by having the right support and the right policies, and that is what the fair shot agenda is all about.", 
                "This afternoon we are going to be voting on a very important piece--which I frankly can't believe we are even having to talk about in 2014--whether we are going to actually enforce equal pay for equal work laws.", 
                "When I think about my own family, my daughter, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter at 7 years old--I hope by the time she grows up we are not still going to be talking about this issue. I think about they are working hard every day and the assumption they have is that they will get paid just as their male counterparts are.", 
                "There are those who have said: Well, this is a distraction. This isn't really an issue. There are some in Michigan who have said: Women don't care about equal pay. What they care about is flexibility.", 
                "My response is flexibility doesn't buy my groceries. It does not buy my daughter's groceries. It does not put gas in her car. It does not pay her mortgage.", 
                "The reality is, in America, in 2014, there is absolutely no reason--zero--that we would not have a 100-percent vote not just on the procedural vote to proceed but on a final bill to make sure enforcement is in place on equal pay--a pretty big deal. An awful lot of women who are the sole breadwinners in their families are counting on us to get this right so they can make sure their kids, who are now going back to school, can have the school clothes they need, they can put the food on the table, they can put the gas in the car to get them to school and get to work, and so on.", 
                "Another big piece of all this agenda in terms of creating opportunity for people is to make sure you can afford to go to college. That same person who is trying to put food on the table would love to put money aside in a bank account for their kids to go to college and would love to know that, when they are doing the right thing--they are making the grade, they are going to college--they will not be stuck with mounds of debt, buried in debt, because we do not have the right kind of system that provides funding for higher education and access to low-interest loans.", 
                "So another piece of the fair shot agenda, which is absolutely critical, is to make sure--let's start with ground zero, which is ``at least''--that anybody who has a student loan now will have a chance to refinance it, just like you would a house, at the lowest possible interest rate, which is impossible today.", 
                "Now, what does that do? We know there is more student loan debt today than credit card debt. Think about that for a minute. There is more student loan debt than credit card debt--$1 trillion. There are mortgage bankers in Michigan saying to me: You have to fix this because I have folks who want to buy a house and they cannot qualify because of their student loan debt. They want to start a small business and they cannot get a loan because of their student loan debt. We also know there are actually people who are on Medicare who are holder than 65 years of age in this country who are still paying off student loan debt. When we talk about opportunity and a basic value of America: Work hard, go to school, have opportunity, it seems to me this flies in the face of that.", 
                "So another really important piece we want to get to and we want to pass is the ability to allow people, step one, to renegotiate and to refinance their student loans at the lowest possible interest rate from last year, which is 3.86 percent for undergraduate students. So that needs to get done so we are addressing one of the huge burdens and costs on middle-class families.", 
                "We also know that, unfortunately, we have another agenda item that came about because of the Supreme Court deciding that for women--that for women only--our choices on preventive health care, on birth control--if we are on the job covered by insurance our boss can actually overrule personal decisions about what type of birth control a woman will choose for herself, for her family. So we have a bill called Not My Boss's Business. I think it is pretty clear. It is not your boss's business what decisions you make, and you should be able to have your birth control decisions and what you need covered just like anything else in terms of preventive health care for men are for women.", 
                "So that is another piece of all of this that needs to get passed to make it clear. This is an economic issue for people. I know in my own family, when I think about my daughter and son and nieces and nephews who are planning their families and making decisions, these are economic issues about health care coverage.", 
                "We have two other critically important economic issues that are part of what we want to get done before this session ends in September. One is raising the minimum wage. It seems to me pretty basic that if you are working 40 hours or more a week you should not be in poverty, plain and simple. If we are going to reward work, if we are going to expect people to work, then working should pay more than not working. If you are working 40 hours a week, you ought to be making more than the poverty level. It has been way too long for American workers to get a pay raise.", 
                "So that is an important part of it.", 
                "Then finally there is a bill that I have introduced that, to me, ought to be a no-brainer. I do not understand; we tried to pass it a couple years ago. It was blocked. And it was blocked again by Republican colleagues a few weeks ago. We need to get this done. It has to do with a part of our Tax Code that allows a company that packs up shop and moves the factory overseas to write off the cost of the move, so the American taxpayers, including workers who just lost their job, would be paying for it.", 
                "Unfortunately, over the years, we have seen too much of that in Michigan. Now things are coming back. Manufacturing is coming back. We are very happy about that. But we want to send a very strong message that if you pack up shop and decide to move overseas, American taxpayers, the workers and their families, the communities are not going to pay for the move. But if you want to come back, we are more than happy to allow you to write off those costs through the Tax Code, and we will even give you another 20 percent tax credit for those costs on top of it.", 
                "So it is very simple. The Bring Jobs Home Act simply says: If you want to come back to America, great, we will help you do that. We will help you pay for those costs to come back to America. But if you want to leave the country, you are on your own.", 
                "So those are the five items that we want to get done before the end of this month that all relate to whether we are going to have opportunity and we are going to focus on the middle class of this country. Too many folks are barely holding on or are not holding on or used to see a path to get to the middle class and cannot anymore. That is not going to work for America. If we do not have people who know they have a fair shot to make it--that they have opportunity, that they see opportunity for their children--if they do not have money in their pocket so they can take care of their family and invest in the future, we are not going to have a strong economy. That is just a fact.", 
                "So we are glad that Wall Street is doing well. But it is time to focus on Main Street, middle-class Americans. That is what the fair shot agenda is all about, and I hope colleagues will come together and help us get this done.", 
                "I yield the floor."

                "Madam President, when I was home last month, I heard a lot from Missourians, for really the first time over and over: What about all of the bills the House has passed that the Senate has not taken up? What about funding the government? My good friend from Michigan just mentioned the five things she would like to get done before we get to the end of the year. I think everybody on the other side of the aisle knows those five things, for various reasons, will not happen this year.", 
                "But what are we not doing? We are less than a month away from the beginning of a new spending year. We have not voted on a single one of the appropriations bills. There is no budget. The fundamental work of the government is not going on while we continue to debate the same things over and over because there are some people who think there is a good title to the bill or a good headline: The five things we want to get done.", 
                "Equal pay. Who is not for equal pay? The law requires equal pay. In fact, when the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act, he said: This solves the problem. Well, suddenly, it does not solve the problem because we want to get that title back out there again where we can talk about the title.", 
                "Access to college. I am the first person in my family to ever graduate from college. I had the chance to be a university president. I believe people's lives are affected by the right kind of education after high school. Nobody is opposed to access to college. We ought to be talking about that. But we ought to be talking about that in a way that can produce the right kind of result.", 
                "When the people of Missouri are saying: You are not getting the work of the country done, that is clearly right--just the fundamental things that need to get done, and here we are back in Washington, reminded by our friends on the other side that really we are here to just hold votes we have already had. Not a single thing was mentioned in the preceding remarks that we have not voted on already and not a single thing was mentioned in the preceding remarks that has any chance of passing both the House and the Senate and, frankly, has no chance of advancing in either the House or the Senate. But here we take these critical 2 weeks--the government is unfunded, no budget to talk about, with work not being done--to talk about these things.", 
                "Right now, the joint resolution we are on--with all the critical challenges we have not solved, we are talking about changing the Constitution. The only person in the Senate who can decide what bill comes to the floor is the majority leader, and the majority leader has brought a joint resolution to the floor, an amendment to the Constitution, an amendment that would take 67 votes in the Senate to pass, an amendment that has 45 sponsors, all from the other side--not very close to 67. Nobody believes this is going to happen.", 
                "To amend the Constitution, two-thirds of the Senate has to agree. That will not happen. Two-thirds of the House has to agree. That will not happen. Two-thirds of the States have to approve the amendment. That will not happen. More importantly, it should not happen. We are talking about amending the Constitution of the United States when there is no chance of doing it. So the only thing we are surely talking about is just trying to score some kind of last-minute election-year points. But if people are paying attention, the points that will be scored will be scored by those defending the Bill of Rights and those defending the Constitution.", 
                "What is being proposed here would have a chilling effect on the First Amendment, which says ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging [among other things] the freedom of speech.'' We are thinking, for the first time ever, we would amend the Bill of Rights? Now, nobody really thinks we are going to do that so apparently everybody thinks, as long as it is just a show vote, it does not matter. But if you can take these freedoms today and decide they are worth bandying around as a show vote, I suppose you could take them tomorrow and actually think about taking these freedoms away.", 
                "The Constitution would not have become the Constitution of the United States without the promise of the Bill of Rights. The Founders got a lot of things right. They did not get everything right. But one of the things they got right was the Bill of Rights. One thing that the States demanded when the Constitution was shown to them was: We can do that, but we are not going to do that unless we are promised that these fundamental rights that make us who we are and have the potential to make us more than we are--that these fundamental rights are guaranteed. We have never amended the Bill of Rights. So suddenly 45 Members of the Senate--with no enthusiasm for this anywhere else that I can find in the country--45 Members of the Senate have decided that for the first time ever we would amend the Bill of Rights.", 
                "Now, what does the Bill of Rights give us? It gives us freedom of religion--the first right. There will be another debate, I assume, late in the next 2 weeks to once again talk about how important is that right of conscience, that the Constitution in the Bill of Rights guarantees--the very first freedom it gives us is the freedom to believe what we believe. In fact, President Jefferson said in the decade after the Constitution was written that of all the rights, that is the one we should hold most dear: the freedom to hold our beliefs and not let the government decide how you conduct yourself in ways that violate your faith beliefs.", 
                "But right after that comes--what we are talking about--freedom of speech, the second of all those freedoms. There may be people here not at all offended by the fact that we can just bandy that around with no chance we are going to change this amendment. It is not like there are 67 cosponsors of this amendment.", 
                "I find it offensive we would talk about this as if it is a freedom so easily discussed and so easily utilized for political reasons that we just bring it up here a few weeks before the election and talk about it, even though there is no chance it could possibly be changed at this point and shouldn't be changed in the future.", 
                "The right of conscience, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the right to peaceably assemble, the right to petition the government--those are the five freedoms given in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and here we are talking about them as if they are nothing more than political talking points. They are who we are as a nation.", 
                "The chilling effect this discussion has on the First Amendment is concerning. I suppose part of it is to convince people: You don't want to participate in the system because you are going to be criticized if you participate in the system.", 
                "One of the great rights we have as Americans is the right to criticize those who are participating and, if we do participate, the right that others have to criticize us. This is an effort that if it occurred would certainly be a great thing for the current occupants of public office because you begin to write the rules in a way that makes it harder for those who don't hold public office to challenge those who do. No one likes being criticized, but in our country it is a fundamental part of who we are.", 
                "The Constitution wouldn't have been agreed to without the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights, as I said before, hasn't been changed. The freedom of the press is one of those rights, but it is not the only one. This amendment would go a long way toward making the press the only way people get their information and news. The press--the media generally--has a guaranteed right to do what they do, but individuals have a guaranteed right to say what they want to say, to participate as the courts and the Constitution allow in this great debate we call America.",

Nobody believes this is going to happen because it is not going to happen. We are taking the people's time.

                "Madam President, I rise today to support the Paycheck Fairness Act. Equal pay for equal work is the law of the land. It has been for over 50 years. Yet the law is one thing and the reality is quite another. Women still get paid far less than men for the same work.", 
                "Last year Hawaii News Now, a TV station in Hawaii, shared the story of a woman in Honolulu. She had been asking for a raise for over a year, to no avail. Her employers acknowledged that she was underpaid, but they didn't do anything about it. Then she found out a new male hire with less experience would be paid $5,000 more to do the same job.", 
                "She is not alone. In Hawaii a woman makes, on average, 83 cents for every dollar a man makes. While that is better than the national average, it is still not equal pay for equal work.", 
                "Research shows that the gender gap in pay begins with a woman's first job and widens from there. So when a young woman graduates and takes her place in the workplace, her starting line is already behind that of her male colleagues. That makes it harder for her to catch up, no matter how hard she works.", 
                "The women I know work incredibly hard. Many of them are heads of households and sole breadwinners, which makes the pay inequality that much tougher for them.", 
                "The gender pay gap persists even for workers with the same level of experience and education. The gap is even wider for older women.", 
                "Congress passed the Equal Pay Act over 50 years ago. As I said earlier, this is the law of the land. Yet the pay gap persists. While the gap has shrunk--not by much--women only earn 77 cents on the dollar nationally. As Senator Mikulski often says, in 50 years, women have only gained a few cents.", 
                "In 2009, I was proud to support and vote for the Lilly Ledbetter Act which President Obama signed into law. It was the very first bill he signed into law after his election. Without this law, women had only 180 days after their first discriminatory paycheck to challenge it, even if they only found out about it years and years later. After all, Lilly's employer did not announce they were discriminating against her in pay. So in her case it took many years, and she was far beyond the 180 days the Supreme Court said would be the timeframe in which she could try and get redress.", 
                "While the Lilly Ledbetter Act addressed one part of the equal pay problem, if we are going to make sure all women get a fair shot, we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. This bill would require employers to prove that pay gaps between men and women are based only on a business reason and not on gender.", 
                "The Paycheck Fairness Act will make it easier for workers to compare their salaries and figure out whether they are victims of discrimination. Right now, without this act, employers can still fire workers for sharing the basic information about how much they are getting paid. This bill strengthens penalties for companies that discriminate against women. It would bring class action protection for women in line with other civil rights laws.", 
                "The bill includes an exemption for small businesses and a phased-in time for businesses to learn what they are required to do.", 
                "In addition, the Paycheck Fairness Act would help prevent pay discrimination in the first place by providing training for both management and workers. This past April 8 was Equal Pay Day. That is the day when women's earnings in this country caught up with men's earnings from the previous year. In other words, it took women 16 months to catch up with what their male counterparts were making in 12 months.", 
                "The very next day, here on the Senate floor, every single Republican Senator voted to filibuster the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed on a procedural vote. I hope our Republican friends will reconsider their position on this important issue this time around.", 
                "This year President Obama signed an Executive order to implement parts of the Paycheck Fairness Act for Federal contractors. That is a major step forward for thousands of women. But there are millions more who are not covered by this executive action. Today in the Senate we have another chance to give the women of our country a fair shot, another chance for us to live up to a law that we passed 50 years ago.", 
                "I urge my colleagues to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without delay. Fifty years is long enough to wait.",

                "Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the tremendous contributions of our former colleague, Edith Starrett Green, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1955-1974, representing Oregon's 3rd District. During her tenure in the House, Mrs. Green was one of the nation's leading advocates for expanding access to higher education for all Americans and ensuring equal pay and opportunities for women and minorities.", 
                "Among her many accomplishments, Mrs. Green authored two landmark pieces of legislation that continue to shape the field of post-secondary education, including the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which authorized the use of Federal funds to expand and improve classrooms, libraries, and laboratories on college and university campuses. She also sponsored the Higher Education Act of 1965, which for the first time authorized Federal financial assistance for undergraduate students. President Lyndon Johnson referred to the Higher Education Facilities Act as ``the greatest step forward in the field since the passage of the Land-Grant Act of 1862.'' Her commitment and success earned Mrs. Green the monikers ``the Mother of Higher Education' and ``Mrs. Education.''", 
                "Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, also was concerned with the issues of equal opportunity and equal pay for women and minorities and advanced pioneering legislation addressing both issues. She was appointed to President John F. Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women and chaired its Civil and Political Rights Committee in the early 1960s. She was the author of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which she helped push across the finish line eight years after first introducing it. She followed that by winning support for her amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1965 to expand the scope of the bill to include training opportunities for urban youth.", 
                "Mrs. Green was known as a shrewd legislator, once called a ``bare-knuckle fighter'' by one Congressional observer, and those skills helped her advance this and other issues close to her heart. She spent much of her public life working to eliminate the social and legal obstacles preventing women from achieving equality in post-secondary education.", 
                "Perhaps most notably, Mrs. Green was one of several members to introduce legislation prohibiting federally-funded colleges and universities from discriminating against women after the idea was born out of seven days of hearings she held on the topic in her role as Chairman of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Higher Education. ``If you can make every young girl know that there's no ceiling of expectations, that there is not height to which that young girl cannot go, she'll aspire to that,'' Mrs. Green said in a 1978 interview. Ultimately, she collaborated with fellow Representative Patsy Mink, of Hawaii, and Senator Birch Bayh, of Indiana, on the groundbreaking Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which opened new academic and athletic opportunities for women and has had a transformative effect on future generations of girls and women across America. Upon her retirement in December 1974, former New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan remarked that ``she presided over the enactment of the most important education legislation in the history of the Republic, and I hope someone would say so.'' Mrs. Green returned to Oregon, where she taught college government classes and passed away in April 1987.", 
                "Mr. Speaker, it has been said before and surely deserves repeating: The passionate and persistent efforts of Congresswoman Edith Green have forever transformed our modern classrooms, athletic fields, and employment settings for the better, and she deserves our sincere respect and gratitude. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the tremendous record of accomplishment compiled by our former colleague, Edith Starrett Green, and in thanking her family for their sacrifice and support of her career, which continues to help advance opportunities for so many others."

Whether it be the draconian cuts that appeared in the House Republican budget, the slashing of food stamps and assistance to the most needy in this country, to see a Republican finally stand up and talk about poverty, we were excited. And we want to have that conversation this evening.", 
                "So just what is in Congressman Paul Ryan's plan to help alleviate poverty? I am sure it must be something about raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in the next 3 years so that we can help lift people who are making $15,000 a year out of poverty. I am sure it addresses equal pay for equal work so that men and women are paid for doing the same work. But it doesn't appear that is part of Paul Ryan's plan.", 
                "I am sure it addresses some educational issues. I am sure it helps people pay back their loans at lower rates and makes sure we have expanded Pell grants available so that no one should be denied a higher education simply because they can't afford it. No, that is not part of the Ryan plan either. ", 
                "I am sure there is an investment in early childhood education, because every person in this room must surely know that if we help invest at those earliest years, you can have a lifetime of experiences and opportunities for someone. That is not in the plan either.", 
                "Surely, it must address investments in infrastructure. We have crumbling roads and bridges. We have bridges and roads that are old enough that they are eligible for Medicare in this country. Surely, putting people back to work at a time like this and investing in our infrastructure would make sense. It is also not in the Ryan plan.", 
                "Let me try one more thing. It has got to be here. We must provide incentives to create good-paying jobs here in America rather than overseas. Clearly, the 21st century Make It In America Act must not be in the plan either.",

They are what we would do in our first 100 days if we were to take over the majority after this fall.", 
                "But surely there must be something we could talk about today in Paul Ryan's plan. There has got to be something equally bold and, hopefully, not just old, a bunch of old ideas warmed over, brought back to us in versions of block grants and not really providing any real assistance that the most needy in this country need.",

In my congressional district alone, 41 percent of children, or 67,000 children, live in poverty. It also is shameful that racial disparities remain in the experience of poverty, with child poverty for African Americans being 29.2 percent, in 2012, compared to 9 percent for their White peers.", 
                "And so I welcome working with anybody that would like to reduce poverty. As a matter of fact, ever since I have been here, I have championed two of the chief proposals mentioned by the Ryan plan: expanding the earned income tax credit to childless and noncustodial parents, as well as reducing incarceration among low-risk and nonviolent offenders.", 
                "The earned income tax credit is one of the most effective antipoverty programs that we have. A Brookings Institution report highlights that the high rate of incarceration in our country exacts considerable cost from American taxpayers, especially from State governments and families.", 
                "However, I am extremely concerned about the proposed way of paying for these programs. Rather than asking large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes or closing international tax loopholes that allow large, multinational companies to evade billions of dollars in taxes, the Ryan plan would eliminate or eviscerate many important programs like the Social Services Block Grant and the Economic Development Administration.", 
                "So I don't know what Mr. Ryan is really talking about. It seems to me that he is talking the same talk we have heard so often."

                "I would like to believe that that is the objective, and I certainly am of the view that the chairman is acting in good faith, as it relates to his willingness to try to tackle the issue of poverty in America, but if you put it all in the context of the Ryan budget that has come to the floor of the House of Representatives year after year after year since the Republicans claimed the majority, which passed with overwhelming support from their caucus, the question is: Is their real interest in expanding opportunity in America, or is the fundamental objective really to expand inequality in America?", 
                "What Paul Ryan are we talking to in attempting to have this conversation? Is it the Chairman Ryan whose budget cut $125 billion in supplemental nutrition assistance in a country where 50 million people are food insecure, 18 million of those individuals children? We can't have a real conversation about opportunity if that is still the position of Chairman Ryan, his Budget Committee, and the majority.", 
                "Are we having a conversation with a chairman whose budget cut $260 billion in higher education funding, threatening to rob young Americans from their pursuit of their dream of obtaining a college education and being all that they can be in America? We can't have a real conversation about opportunity with individuals who want to cut $260 billion in higher education spending.", 
                "I want to believe that we can proceed in good faith and try and tackle this issue. But are we entering into a discussion with the same group of individuals, the chairman whose budget cut $732 billion in Medicaid, a program designed to benefit, in significant numbers, poor, elderly, and disabled individuals? That is not expanding opportunity in America. That is expanding inequality in America.", 
                "Certainly, there are some proposals contained in the document that was unveiled today that we can embrace and have a meaningful discussion about in trying to arrive at common ground--sentencing reform as well as the notion of expanding the earned income tax credit. But there is no minimum wage enhancement. There is no infrastructure investment. There is no unemployment compensation insurance renewal. There is no equal pay for equal work, and there is no real effort to deal with the issues that we are prepared to work on to solve the problem of poverty for millions of Americans. For that reason, I am skeptical that this is a step in the right direction."

                "Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Geraldine Ferraro's nomination as the Democratic candidate for Vice President of the United States.", 
                "On the night of July 19, 1984, Gerry gave her acceptance speech as the first woman to be nominated for U.S. Vice President by a majority party. I was there, experiencing the thrill, excitement, and turbo energy as 10,000 people jammed the Mosconi Center. Male delegates gave their tickets to female alternate delegates and their daughters. Gerry's walk on stage was electrifying. We gave her a 10-minute resounding ovation and wouldn't sit down. That night, a barrier was broken. That night, they took down the ``men only'' sign on the White House. For Gerry and all American women there was no turning back--only going forward.", 
                "Some people only knew Gerry as a political phenomenon, but I first knew her in Congress. She was a born fighter--for New York and every little guy and gal. She was an advocate for women, fighting for our status and giving us a new stature. Long after the campaign was over, she continued to be a source of inspiration and empowerment.", 
                "When Gerry was chosen for the Vice Presidential nomination, she showed modern American women what we had become and what we could be. Women felt that if Gerry could go for the White House, we could go for anything. For some of us women, that meant going to Congress to make a difference. Today, I know Gerry would be so proud of all we have accomplished. Back when we met in the House, we were the early birds. We weren't afraid to ruffle some feathers, but we were in the minority. In 1979, there were 16 women in the House: 11 Democrats and 5 Republicans, and 2 women of color. Today, there are 79 women in the House: 60 Democrats, 19 Republicans, and 30 women of color. As the Dean of the Senate Women, I am proud we are 20 women strong in the Senate: 16 Democrats and 4 Republicans. Together, we are changing the tide and changing the tone.", 
                "We have had some amazing victories along the way. We increased breast cancer research funding at NIH by 750 percent to $657 million in fiscal year 13. We increased childcare funding by 75 percent--$2.2 billion in fiscal year 14. We made sure good science included women by founding the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health. The research from that office has changed medical practices, reduced breast cancer by 15 percent, and saved lives a million at a time. This year, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which kept the courthouse doors open for women to sue for discrimination. Last October, women on both sides of the aisle created the climate for compromise that was crucial to ending the disastrous government shutdown.", 
                "We have had some amazing victories, but we still have more to do. The Senate women are fighting for women across America. We know women need a raise to raise their families. That is why we are fighting for equal pay for equal work and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. We are fighting for a better minimum wage because we know that a full-time job shouldn't mean full-time poverty. We are fighting for education that helps our kids every step of the way. We want to give working families peace of mind and give children quality care for a brighter future. Passing my bipartisan child care and development block grant bill will bring affordable, accessible childcare to working families.", 
                "Women need a social safety net they can count on, at every age and in every stage. That is why we are fighting so hard for seniors by saving Medicare from becoming a coupon and a promise. We are ensuring Social Security remains guaranteed, lifetime and inflation proof. We are also fighting for health care that is affordable and accessible, by passing the Affordable Care Act to end gender discrimination in health care. I was so proud when we passed my Mikulski preventive health amendment, so simply being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition. We are taking a stand against the Supreme Court decision that denies women contraception and family planning, while valuing employer rights over employee rights. And we are fighting to ensure the safety and education of women and girls around the world--whether they are in Nigeria, Central America, or Afghanistan.", 
                "When Gerry took the stage at the 1984 Democratic Convention, she forever altered the course of history. For the rest of her life, she remained dedicated to empowering thousands of women in the United States and around the world. Today, we honor her lasting legacy and her impact on generations of women with a dream--and a desire to make a difference."

                "Let's look at who ambassadors really are. Here in the Senate, I had the good fortune to serve with one of the really distinguished ambassadors, Daniel Patrick Moynihan from New York. Prior to coming to the Senate, he was our Ambassador to India. He left his mark on that country. He did a remarkably good job as Ambassador from the United States to India.", 
                "The Republican leader and I attended a funeral a week or so ago in Tennessee. The funeral was for Howard Baker, who had been the majority leader in the Senate--a fine man. He married another Senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. He became, after retiring from the Senate, our Ambassador to Japan. He distinguished himself there again with the remarkably good job he did.", 
                "We can go back and look at the beginning of the history of this country. What do we always learn about Thomas Jefferson? We know how smart he was, how he wrote brilliantly. But we also learned in every history lesson about Thomas Jefferson, that he was our Ambassador to France. John Adams was our Ambassador to England. They have set the standard for how important ambassadors are.", 
                "Here in the Senate Republicans are stalling ambassadors. Twenty-five percent of all the ambassadorships to the continent of Africa--unfilled. There are gaping holes in our Nation's front lines. Approximately 30 ambassadors are waiting to be confirmed--and waiting and waiting and waiting.", 
                "Senate Republicans, who have been so quick to accuse this administration of poor leadership on world issues, are obstructing the confirmation of ambassadors who are desperately needed at embassies all around the world. Republicans are abdicating the Senate's constitutional role to confirm ambassadors.", 
                "In previous years ambassadors were just approved so quickly. Once in a while something controversial would come up, but it was once in a great while. As I said, a quarter of U.S. Embassies in Africa do not have an ambassador. We do not have an ambassador in Bosnia. We do not have an ambassador in Vietnam--on and on. Can't we all agree that it is important that American interests be represented in these places? The answer: We cannot agree. The Republicans do not want these ambassadorships filled.", 
                "When can these people who want to play in the ``all-star game'' be able to play in the ``all-star game'' and represent the interests of this country? They work in careers that are very difficult. They do not start out as ambassadors. Rarely does that happen.", 
                "Each day that goes by more ambassadorships are unfilled. All the ambassador nominees were passed out of committee unanimously. With rare exception they are noncontroversial. I am talking about career ambassadors. These are not political appointees. I am talking about career ambassadors.", 
                "What does that mean when I say career ambassadors, career diplomats? These are good men and women who have worked for decades for the U.S. State Department. In most cases these diplomats started working at the lowest levels, processing visa applications, asylum requests, and then became an economic officer, a political officer. By working hard and requiring the necessary expertise, these career diplomats have readied themselves to be ambassadors. It is hard.", 
                "Career diplomats do not represent political parties, they represent our country. These long-time professionals have worked for both Democrats and Republicans. They worked for several different administrations. It does not matter, if someone is a Foreign Service officer, whether the President is a Democrat or Republican, they do their job for the country.", 
                "Now these professionals are needed to fill vital ambassadorial posts in some of the most volatile regions in the world. Republicans have slammed the brakes on these nominations. At the very least the Senate should confirm these noncontroversial career diplomats. If they want to play games with the political appointees, they can do that, but these career diplomats are not political appointees. They are qualified diplomats who have performed admirably for the State Department for a long time. We need their experience, we need their expertise at embassies all over the world.", 
                "Some Senate observers say Republicans are stalling these nominations as a payback for rules changes instituted by the Senate. Let's see if I can try to figure this one out. Republicans are stalling Executive nominees vital to our national interests to get back at Democrats, to get back at me. How is that? Stalling these nominees is jeopardizing America's interests abroad. It is damaging our Nation's role in global affairs. It is damaging our national security. Is this conjured-up political retribution worth harming the United States? Of course not.", 
                "There was a New York Times article within the last 48 hours where Secretary of State John Kerry said: I have 52 important State Department officials who are waiting to be confirmed in the Senate--52. I was stunned to read in that same article a quote from the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee over here, the junior Senator from Tennessee.", 
                "Here is what he said: ``Rather than filling vacant embassies to alleviate the national security concerns raised by Secretary Kerry and others, the majority leader-- Listen to this one.", 
                "--who controls the Senate floor--has chosen to spend this week on a sportsman's bill and previous weeks confirming judges.", 
                "Why criticize me for bringing up the sportsmen's bill? This bill was sponsored by a majority of the Republicans. Twenty-six Republicans cosponsored that legislation. The junior Senator from Tennessee is complaining that I brought that up. I guess he is also complaining that I brought up raising the minimum wage, which the Republicans filibustered. Maybe he is also complaining that we have student debt in this country--about $1.3 trillion--and we brought that up to alleviate the pain to families in America with student debt.", 
                "Maybe he is complaining because we brought up on the Senate floor something extremely important; that is, that if a woman does the same work as a man, she should get paid the same amount of money--not different work, the same work. She should get the same money. I guess he is complaining because we brought up something that addresses the needs that Americans have; that is, the Hobby Lobby decision from the Supreme Court. We think that is wrong. Women in America, families in America, with some exception, believe that is wrong.", 
                "So I agree with the junior Senator from Tennessee. There is an urgent need to fill these diplomatic posts as soon as possible, but for heaven's sake, how could he complain about the substantive legislation which is so important to America that I have just run through?", 
                "Then he complains about judges, we are confirming judges. I have been here a while in the Senate. Until Obama became President, with some exception, these nominations went through on unanimous consent. We were not holding up ambassadors. There would be a spat on a judge here and there but not holding up all of the judges. The reason it is taking so long is we have, under the rules of the Senate, what we call postcloture time. That time was originally set up so after we got on a piece of legislation or on a nomination, we could think about it for a little bit. They think about it a lot and do nothing.", 
                "Thirty hours on a lot of nominations postcloture, 8 hours on others, judges only 2 hours. We have been able to go through a lot of judges because of that rule change that we made. I thought it was an urgent need 4 months ago when I came to the Senate floor to talk about the growing logjam of our ambassadorial corps around the country. But Senator Corker's reasoning that these ambassadorial confirmations were delayed unnecessarily by legislation and judicial confirmations is a little weird, a little strange. It is strange and weird for a number of reasons.", 
                "I take issue with the notion that the Senate somehow wasted time by legislating and confirming judicial nominees. These are our constitutional duties. We are going to confirm, in the next few days, a post in Georgia. We have two to be filled there. One of them has been waiting for more than 1,000 days. So I think it is important we do this. Why? Because it is our constitutional duty.", 
                "We only have so much time to confirm judges, because as I indicated, filibustering nominees, they do it to everybody. We are working through the judges quickly because we changed the rules. Thank goodness we did. The Senate did consider Senator Hagan's sportsmen's legislation last week. I repeat. That important bill affects--the one that the junior Senator from Tennessee said we should not have brought up--affects 40 million Americans who hunt and fish.", 
                "Somebody I used to practice law with has a place in Montana. He took his grandson there and had a wonderful time fishing--no hunting but fishing. This place he has, a little stream goes by there. He said it was the best time he ever had with his grandchild. That is what 40 million people do. That is what we brought up. That is what the junior Senator from Tennessee said was such a bad idea. Twenty-six Republicans cosponsored that legislation. It contributes $200 billion annually to our Nation's economy.", 
                "My friend from Tennessee thinks it is a waste of time; we should not have done that. The junior Senator from Tennessee was a cosponsor of the legislation. He is going to go back and tell the people in Tennessee that he made a mistake, he should not have been a cosponsor.", 
                "Earlier, he voted to proceed so we could work on the legislation. Then he voted to filibuster it. This is the same tactic we have seen so much over the past 6 years. Republicans obstruct. When asked why they are not accomplishing anything, they blame Democrats. They blame me. The truth is Senate Democrats have continued to press for more and more ambassadorial confirmations while also introducing legislation that helps working families.", 
                "As I came to the floor in March to highlight the backlog of ambassadorial confirmations, the Senate has considered an increase in the minimum wage, equal pay for women, student loan refinancing, extension of tax cuts, cost-cutting energy legislation, and a number of other items. These are all important bills to give working Americans a fair shot at a measure of prosperity. Republican filibusters blocked every one of them.", 
                "Another issue I have with the Senator from Tennessee is that undoubtedly he knows the Senate traditionally does much of its business through unanimous consent--in fact most of our business. If Republicans agree there is an urgent need to get these nominations done and give their consent, we could confirm all of these ambassadors in a single afternoon. It would only take a few hours in the afternoon. We could do it today.", 
                "But it is clearly not a priority for Republicans; otherwise, they would expedite these confirmations. Their behavior on these ambassadorial nominations reminds me of a quote by Gandhi: ``Action expresses priorities.'' Republicans' lack of action on this matter illustrates that they have no priorities in this regard.", 
                "So enough with the stalling and enough with retribution. The Senate standoff is not good for this body, and it is hurting American interests abroad. Let's get these ambassador posts filled. Our national security depends on it."

                "Upon her confirmation, Cheryl LaFleur will remain at the FERC as chair for 9 months. Following that period of time, Norman Bay will then assume the position of FERC chair.", 
                "I appreciate very much the work done by a number of Senators to get us to the point where we are. The chair of the energy committee, Senator Mary Landrieu, has done really hard work, and it has been a bipartisan effort to move these nominations forward.", 
                "I have been assured by both nominees that the issue which the Wall Street Journal editorialized about yesterday--and they called it ``the federal takeover of New York's electric grid''--will be addressed.

                "Mr. President, last week my friend, the Republican leader, essentially declared victory for American women in their struggle for equality by saying:", 
                "We've come a long way in pay equity and there are a ton of women CEO's now running major companies. . . . I could be wrong, but I think most of the barriers [for American women] have been lowered.", 
                "The Republican leader seems to be suggesting the obstacles preventing women from receiving equal treatment under the law have been conquered--the struggle for equality for women is over. ", 
                "The only things missing from the Republican leader's declaration would be an aircraft carrier and a large ``MISSION ACCOMPLISHED'' sign hanging in the background. We all remember that. Remember, that was President Bush declaring the war in Iraq was basically over. Well, it was not. And the war regarding women is not over.", 
                "The Republican leader suggested that the notion of ensuring equal rights for American women is tantamount to ``preferential treatment.'' That was his opinion. That is as shocking as it is troubling.", 
                "The truth is, regardless of what Republicans in Congress may say, the barriers of inequality for American women are very real and very substantial. Take this as an example. There are many examples, but let's try this one: The Republican leader mentioned pay equity. American women are paid an average of 77 cents for every $1 their male colleagues make for doing the exact same work. It is not fair. But instead of working with Senate Democrats to give working women a fair shot at equal pay for equal work, Republicans refuse to even let the legislation be debated. This was one of their multitude of filibusters.", 
                "The Republican leader also spoke of the growing number of women CEOs at major companies. Now try this one on: Currently, among Fortune Magazine's listing of the 500 top companies in the world, there are 24 chief executives who are women. That is 4.8 percent of all the CEOs in the Fortune 500. If anyone believes--including my friend, the Republican leader--that fewer than 1 in 20 is good enough, this perfectly illustrates the Republicans' antiquated beliefs concerning working women and American women in general.", 
                "But perhaps the most disturbing reminder of the inequality barriers that women face is the Supreme Court's recent Hobby Lobby decision. Just a few weeks ago, five men on the U.S. Supreme Court gave corporate bosses the right to interfere with their employees' decisions about birth control.", 
                "In its Hobby Lobby decision, those five Justices ruled that for-profit companies can assert religious objections to deny their employees--who may not share their same religious views--the contraceptive coverage required by law. That is what the Court said.", 
                "The Court's decision was stunningly wrong. The Court's misguided decision effectively takes away the right of American women to decide their own health care, instead empowering boardrooms to make final decisions on their employees' access to birth control.", 
                "How is it possible that in the 21st century we are debating whether or not bosses should be able to dictate their employees' family planning? It is 2014. It is not 1906 or 1907 or 1915.", 
                "Health coverage is a form of payment or compensation for employees.", 
                "There is a strike going on in New York--they are going to start Monday, I am told--for the largest short-haul railroad. Mr. President, 300,000 people ride that every day. What is the big sticking point? It is health care. Health care is a big deal to everybody. Health care is a form of payment or compensation for employees. Should employers' religious beliefs be able to dictate how you spend your paycheck and your days off? Of course not. So why would we let bosses decide something so personal and so private as the use of contraceptives?", 
                "Last week Senators Patty Murray and Mark Udall introduced the Not My Boss's Business Act to fix the Hobby Lobby decision. This legislation would make it illegal for any company to deny their workers specific health benefits, including birth control, as required by Federal law.", 
                "The Murray-Udall bill preserves the exemption for houses of worship and the accommodation for religious nonprofits that have religious objections to contraceptive coverage.", 
                "The decision to use birth control is private--and it should be--and it should not be subject to the personal or religious beliefs of some corporate boss; otherwise, where is it going to end? As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in her dissenting opinion:", 
                "Would the exemption . . . extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions; antidepressants; medications derived from pigs--", 
                "And there are medications derived from swine that help people get well--", 
                "including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin; and vaccinations?",

                "That is why I support this bill, which clearly establishes a woman's right to quality health care. By passing the Not My Boss's Business Act, the U.S. Senate can knock down a significant barrier to women's equality. Regardless of what Republicans in Congress will tell you, we have a long, long way to go before American women are equal in all aspects of the law, as they should be.",

                "For him to suggest that a matter of this magnitude, in a body that requires 60 votes for almost everything, is going to be done with 51 votes makes no sense at all.", 
                "Again he said:", 
                "So it is not at all unusual that the President's proposal of this consequence . . . would have to achieve 60 votes. That is the way virtually all business is done in the Senate ", 
                "The Republican leader holds himself as the person who has established this rule--the so-called McConnell rule--and is boasting about it. He has insisted on the 60-vote threshold time and time again over the past 5 years. So it is without logic, and it would deviate from the norm, that he, the Republican leader, has made. So I guess that is where we are. We are now operating under a 60-vote threshold and that is the norm that he, the Republican leader, has established around here.", 
                "The Republican leader's newfound support of the 51-vote threshold is timely, given his proposal to curb EPA regulatory powers because of an issue he thinks exists, even though there has been no rule promulgated by the White House. He is looking way off into the future. We have had months and months of people offering their opinions and suggestions as to how, if at all, this proposed rule could be changed, but he wants to do something about it even though there is nothing to change right now.", 
                "It is patently unfair to give the Republican leader a simple majority vote on his amendment when there have been so many other pieces of legislation he has blocked with the 60-vote threshold. However, we Democrats are willing to meet the Republican leader and his caucus halfway.", 
                "Here is the suggestion. We will agree to a simple majority vote on the Republican leader's EPA amendment in exchange for a 51-vote threshold on bills that are important to American families, such as an increase in the Federal minimum wage. A vast majority of the American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--want the minimum wage raised.", 
                "How about a vote on equal pay for working women? The vast majority of American people want their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters to have the same paycheck when they do the same work as a man.", 
                "How about legislation permitting student borrowers to refinance their student loans? They blocked us on that legislation with the 60-vote threshold.", 
                "How about energy efficiency legislation? They blocked that many times.", 
                "How about a simple majority vote on the disclosure of campaign contributions? How about a simple majority vote on updating voting right protections that the Supreme Court did away with? How about a simple majority vote for background checks on gun purchases? Eight-five to 90 percent of the American people support that, and over half the NRA members support that.", 
                "What I am saying is, OK, if the Republican leader wants to vote on the EPA amendment with a simple majority vote, fine, we will take that. But let's have a simple majority vote on these other issues we feel are extremely important to help the middle class.", 
                "In exchange for a simple majority vote on legislation--I repeat, legislation that is so timely--such as, minimum wage, student loans, equal pay for men and women, energy efficiency legislation, and background checks for gun purchases, we could have a simple majority vote on the EPA amendment.", 
                "It is only fair that bills blocked by the McConnell rule be granted the same treatment as the Republican leader's own legislation. To do otherwise would be unjust to the many Senators who introduced legislation that is important to American families.", 
                "I hope we can come to a quick agreement on this offer and move to an open amendment process on appropriations bills, which should make Republicans happy. They said they wanted amendments; they can have amendments.",

                "Madam President, Senate Democrats have been focused on a lot of ways to expand opportunity and economic security for women and mothers in today's workforce. We have talked about the need to ensure equal pay for equal work, to make childcare more affordable, and to encourage profamily workplace policies that help workers be good parents and good employees.", 
                "We have explained how each of those policies and others would give working women and mothers a better shot at success. It is important to keep in mind that times have changed in the last few decades. Today two-thirds of families with children have two working parents. Dads are taking a more hands-on role in raising their children. This means in many working families fathers are increasingly facing a lot of the same challenges that mothers do. In fact, more and more fathers report they are struggling to balance work and family.", 
                "At a time when so many families need both parents to be at work in order to make ends meet, we clearly need to update our policies so that both mothers and fathers can succeed at work and at home. So today, since it was just Father's Day, I asked a few dads to come in and speak with my colleagues and me about how many of the policies often thought of as especially important to working women, such as affordable childcare, paid sick leave, would also do a lot for dads. I want to thank them for taking the time to share their stories and their experiences with all of us, because what we heard was really powerful. We heard fathers speak about how family-friendly policies helped them raise their kids and meet their responsibilities at work.", 
                "We heard from a dad who decided to stay home with his twins rather than pay for childcare because it was simply too expensive. We heard from a father and a small business owner who has made fair pay a priority at his business because he knows how fast those lost wages add up and how much equal pay can mean for a working family with a mortgage or student loans or car payments or all three of those.", 
                "What these fathers made clear is the economic barriers we often see as impacting women, such as inflexible workplace policies or the high cost of childcare or unequal pay, are not just holding women back, they are holding 21st century families back. There is no question in my mind they are a drag on our economy. That is why Democrats are fighting for policies that would help hard-working mothers and fathers across the country.", 
                "We are fighting to make sure women get equal pay for equal work, just as we made sure women do not get charged more for health insurance because of their gender. We have legislation to expand access to affordable quality childcare and early education so that mothers and fathers can go to work knowing their children are safe and thriving while they are away.", 
                "We have also proposed raising the minimum wage so parents are not working full time but still stuck in poverty and struggling to make ends meet. Democrats are also fighting to help our workers compete for good jobs by bringing down tuition costs and ensuring workers can get the training and education they need.", 
                "There is much more we can do as well. But any of those policies would go an enormously long way toward helping working families get the fair shot they deserve. This is why it has been so disappointing to see that when it comes to everything from the Paycheck Fairness Act to the raising of minimum wage for millions of our workers, to helping ease the burden of student loans, our Republican colleagues have so far said no, even though these policies are policies that would help millions of our working families and even though we know Americans across the country strongly support these kinds of changes. I know they would certainly mean a lot to many of the fathers I spoke with today.", 
                "I came here today to say I hope our Republican colleagues rethink the approach they have taken on all of those issues so far, because I believe if we take steps to break down the barriers working mothers and fathers are facing in today's economy, families across our country will have more opportunity and our country will be stronger now and over the long term.", 
                "There is no reason for us not to get to work on these.",

                "Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to support the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This bill would allow eligible students refinance their Federal loans, transfer private loans into Federal loans with better interest rates, and eliminates tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires. This bill would help more than 25 million students in the United States, including 481,000 student borrowers in Maryland.", 
                "Middle-class families and their children deserve a fair shot at higher education. Students deserve fair, affordable loans to help them get the education they need to succeed, and the working women of America deserve a fair shot at fair pay with equal pay for equal work. Right now, millions of American students are graduating from college and universities, but as they are handed their diplomas, they are being handed a lifetime of debt. The average student debt for 2012 college graduates was $29,400, and for the first time in U.S. history, student loan debt topped credit card debt at $1 trillion. When you are fresh out of college and paying living expenses and investing in a 401(k), these loans add up and become burdensome.", 
                "This especially affects young women struggling to pay debts against a wage gap. College-educated women earn just 82 cents for every dollar a man makes, but they don't get an 18 percent wage gap discount on their student loans. How can we expect women to achieve their dream when they are burdened with crippling debt and fighting against a wage gap that continues to grow over time?", 
                "Recently, a Maryland woman wrote to me. She is a single mother and was on welfare for 9 months after giving birth to her son but said she did not want to become a statistic. She pursued higher education so she could improve her life. She got a bachelor's degree and a master's degree and graduated in the top 5 percent of her class. While attending school, she worked full time and raised her son. She enrolled in an income-based loan program and despite paying more than requested each month, her interest rate has increased. She cannot care for her son and pay off $63,000 in student loans without assistance in refinancing her loans.", 
                "The women of America want more. Women make up almost half of the workforce and 40 percent are the sole breadwinners for families but still only make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. African-American women earn 62 cents and Hispanic women earn 54 cents. Even if they have the same grades, degree, and job title, women are consistently paid less in their first job out of college. On average, women will lose more than $431,000 over their lifetimes because of the wage gap. This doesn't just affect student loans; It affects their contributions to Social Security, pensions, and retirement security.", 
                "I am so proud of America's women. We have accomplished so much. We have gone to space, become CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies and even made it into the U.S. Senate. Today, women are graduating from higher education in record numbers. It is time to help them get a fair shot at achieving their dreams. That starts with equal pay.", 
                "Getting a college education is the core of the American dream. I am fighting to make sure that every student has access to that dream. Let's work together to make sure that when students graduate, their first mortgage isn't their student debt. Carrying the burden of student loans drags down young people's financial future, making it harder to buy a home, start a family, or save for retirement. I support Senator Warren's bill because it reduces debt and fights for American families. It lowers interest rates, giving everyone a fair shot at repaying their loans for a more secure financial future because women deserve a fair shot at getting equal pay for equal work.", 
                "I have said this often, but we in this country enjoy many freedoms: the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of religion. But there is an implicit freedom our constitution doesn't lay out in writing, but its promise has excited the passions, hopes, and dreams of people in this country since its founding. The freedom to take whatever talents God has given you, to fill whatever passion is in your heart, to learn so you can earn and make a contribution--the freedom to achieve.", 
                "When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls school, my Mom and Dad made it clear they wanted me to go to college. But right around graduation my family was going through a rough time because my Dad's grocery store had suffered a terrible fire. I offered to put off college and work at the grocery store until the business got back on its feet. My Dad said, ``Barb, you have to go. Your mother and I will find a way, because no matter what happens to you, no one can ever take that degree away from you. The best way I can protect you is to make sure you can earn a living all of your life.'' My father gave me the freedom to achieve. And this legislation will give millions of Americans that same freedom without adding a dime to the deficit.", 
                "Senator Warren's legislation should be passed in a swift, expeditious, and uncluttered way. It gives our students access to the American dream. It gives our young people access to the freedom to achieve, to be able to follow their talents, and to be able to achieve higher education in whatever field they will be able to serve this country.", 
                "While our work isn't done when it comes to ensuring access to affordable higher education, this bill helps us get there. While these bills will fix the problem today, I will continue to work with my colleagues to figure out a longer-term solution."

                "Madam President, I want to speak for just a few minutes in favor of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, which is the measure before the Senate now, also referred to as the Fair Shot for College Affordability.", 
                "We have been calling this agenda a fair shot, but let's be honest about it. It is just plain common sense. I do not want to go any further without thanking the present occupant of the chair, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, for her dynamic and great leadership on this issue and on these kinds of issues that affect college affordability, and especially this overburdensome student debt that is hanging not only over students but over our entire country.", 
                "There are some things, as I said, that are just plain common sense. Raising the minimum wage is good for American workers. It increases aggregate demand, and it will increase GDP. It is common sense. Equal pay for equal work is the right thing to do for women. It is common sense. And this bill that lets struggling student loan borrowers refinance their loans is not only good for them but also good for our country and good for our economy.", 
                "Families across the country are struggling with student loan debt. It is not only holding them back personally, it is holding us back as a nation. It is holding them back from buying homes and starting families. It is holding back doctors from practicing primary care. It is hurting people trying to save for retirement. It is hurting rural communities that are working to attract doctors or lawyers or veterinarians or whatever.", 
                "But you need not take my word for it. Some of the Nation's most prominent economic officials have raised concerns over this student debt issue. Members of the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Open Market Committee, in March 2013--over a year ago--expressed concern that ``the high level of student debt'' is a risk to aggregate household spending over the next 3 years. The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research has stated that student debt ``could significantly depress demand for mortgage credit and dampen consumption''--again, a drag on our economy. New York Fed president William Dudley told reporters in November of last year: ``People can have trouble with the student loan debt burden--unable to buy cars, unable to buy homes. . . .''", 
                "So I am pleased to see that President Obama has taken action to ease the burden of Federal student loan debt for some struggling borrowers. I am also pleased to see the administration is taking critical steps to ensure that servicemembers are getting the benefits they have earned through their service to our country. But it is very clear that much more needs to be done. That is why this bill before us is so important. It will provide relief to student borrowers who took out loans several years ago only to see the rates for student loans have since gone down.", 
                "Some Senators may remember this issue presented itself last year. So as the chair of the authorizing committee, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle and with the administration--we had meetings in the White House--to pass the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, which lowered interest rates and also authorized the interest rates at 3.86 percent last year for undergraduates, 5.41 percent for Stafford loans for graduate students, and 6.41 percent for parent and graduate PLUS loan borrowers. We want borrowers who may have taken out loans in the past with higher rates to take advantage of these lower rates.", 
                "The Department of Education estimates that 25 million borrowers would likely refinance their existing student loans under this legislation. It will save them money. It will give them money in their pockets where they can now go out and start buying things and increase what we need to have done in our country, which is aggregate demand.", 
                "The legislation also allows student loan borrowers to refinance their private loans into the Federal program--very important.", 
                "The bill provides those who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are in good standing have the option of refinancing their high-interest private loans down to rates offered to new Federal student loan borrowers this year. Those who refinance will also have access to the benefits and protections of the Federal student loan program.", 
                "As I said, this bill is just common sense. American consumers have been able to take advantage of historically low interest rates on their homes, their cars. I have heard a number of speakers who have come out here and said: If you had a high-interest loan on your 25-year or 30-year house mortgage, and you could come in and refinance down to 5 percent, sometimes even less than that, you would be foolish not to do it. You can do it. We should not let students do the same thing? It is good for them and good for the economy.", 
                "Again, I want to say that while this issue of student debt is critically important, by no means is it the only issue that deserves our attention in higher education policy. Right now I think maybe the most critical, simply because of the huge debt burden overhanging our students--I should say our former students and their families, but there are some other things we have to pay attention to.", 
                "In the coming days I plan to release from our committee, release from the chairman's mark, the issue we should be attacking in a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Our committee over the last several months has held more than 10 hearings on issues ranging from teacher preparation to accreditation. These hearings have been bipartisan. I want to thank Senator Alexander for his partnership in making sure we had good hearings.", 
                "As we move forward, our committee is committed to remaining on a bipartisan path for us taking up a Higher Education Act reauthorization. What I plan to put forward is consistent with that bipartisan approach. It simply provides clear guidelines based on the work we have done already. The Higher Education Act we will be coming forward with in the next few weeks will cover basically four topics: 1, affordability; 2, student debt; 3, accountability; and, 4, transparency. As it relates to affordability, we hope to increase affordability and reduce college costs on the front end by entering into a partnership with States, incentivizing States that make strong investments in their systems of higher education.", 
                "The one thing that came through in our hearings on why tuition has gone up so much and college costs have gone up so much for students and their families over the last 20 to 30 years--well, there are a lot of indices of why that has happened, but the single largest factor has been over the last 20 to 30 years the decrease in States investing in higher education.", 
                "What has happened is State legislatures figured it out. They quit putting more money into higher education. The schools raised their tuition, and the students come to the Federal Government or the private sector and borrow the money to go to school. States have abdicated their responsibility in higher education. We plan to offer incentives for States that step up to the bar and then provide more vigorous funding for higher education, that they will get better support from the Federal Government.", 
                "With student debt, we plan to help student borrowers better manage their loan debt through measures such as better upfront and exit counseling on their loans. Again, I hope that tomorrow we would pass our bill, the bill Senator Warren has worked so hard on and championed. I hope we would pass it and get it behind us. But I fully intend to take the measures in that bill and incorporate them into our broader bill on student debt.", 
                "On accountability, we plan to hold schools more accountable to both students and taxpayers by ensuring that no Federal money that goes to students who then go to the schools is used for things such as marketing, advertising. They use it to drive up enrollments. No. If schools want to do that, under our proposal they would not do that with taxpayers' money.", 
                "On transparency, we hope to empower students and families by giving them better information from the beginning of the college process in how they select the school all the way through making sure they know all of their repayment options when they graduate and can make the right choice for their particular circumstances.", 
                "What we need is a good comparison. If a student wants to go to college A, they can go online, they can find out what the costs are for a credit hour, what the tuition is, other forms of information on what they can expect from that school--graduation rates, time to graduate, all kinds of things such as that.", 
                "They can hit the compare button, then go to college B. They can ask the same questions of college B, hit the compare button, go to college C. Then you can bring up and compare all of these schools. I think students and their families would make wiser decisions if they could compare one school to another. That is hard to do today, almost impossible to do today. But that is the kind of transparency parents and children and families need to have.", 
                "I look forward to sharing that proposal, as I said, in the next few weeks. I state publicly: Anyone who has ideas on this and would like to have them incorporated in our bill, please come to our staff or see me. We will try to work it through. As I said, I do want to approach this on a bipartisan basis and work this out. Higher education is too important to our society, to our future as a country, to be a partisan type of approach. It has to be bipartisan.", 
                "College affordability, skyrocketing student debt, accountability, transparency, all are very high-stakes issues for our students and their families and for our future as a country. Certainly in today's difficult economy, with young Americans in particular struggling to find good employment and a foothold in life, it is unacceptable to ask students, graduates, and their families to shoulder unnecessarily high student loan interest payments.", 
                "That is why this bill is so important for us to pass tomorrow, I guess, when it comes up for a vote. I hope we can pass this, and then I hope we can move on with the rest of what we need to do in higher education, as I said, on accountability, on transparency, and affordability. If we can get a good vote and pass this student debt bill so we can start lowering interest rates, that would be the first step toward addressing the issues confronting us in higher education. I hope we can get bipartisan support for this measure tomorrow and then move on to the other issues we have to address in higher education.",

                "Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Begich, for coming and joining me today because I know he is deeply committed to strengthening and protecting Social Security for current and future seniors. So I was very pleased to join him today in introducing the RAISE Act, which will be a very critical step forward in this effort.", 
                "Over the last several decades, middle class families have been increasingly squeezed by rising prices for everything from college tuition to health care. Wages have stayed flat--or even declined for some people--and fewer companies today are offering the kinds of generous pension plans that used to help so many workers stay financially secure.", 
                "With all that in mind, it is not surprising that, as families have struggled to stretch their dollars further and further in order to get the bills paid and raise their children, it has become harder and harder to save for retirement.", 
                "In fact, a recent study showed that more than a third of today's workers have been unable to save even a dollar for retirement, and even those who do have savings do not have very much. The same study found that 60 percent of respondents had less than $25,000 in total assets and investments, excluding their home.", 
                "The numbers are even more pronounced when you look at women in the workforce. Because women, on average, earn less than men, they accumulate less in savings, they receive smaller pensions, and nearly 3 in 10 women over 65 depend only on Social Security for income in their later years.", 
                "It is clear that now more than ever Social Security is a lifeline for millions of seniors. So it is especially important for us to make sure this critical system is meeting the needs of today's beneficiaries.", 
                "For 75 years our Social Security system has offered millions of seniors and their families a foundation of financial security. But a lot has changed in those 75 years. Today, most families have two earners. Because Social Security was actually designed for single-earner families, surviving spouses in families where both adults worked may receive less in benefits than they deserve.", 
                "Social Security also supports children whose parents retired, became disabled or passed away--but those benefits end at the age 18 or 19. That is right. When young adults should be thinking about continuing their education--a necessity in today's economy--they are worried about having nowhere to go.", 
                "At a time when Social Security is an increasingly critical source of support for so many, the RAISE Act would make some commonsense updates to ensure our Social Security system is doing everything possible to help today's seniors and their families.", 
                "As the Senator from Alaska described, the RAISE Act would establish a new alternative benefit to make sure widows and widowers from two-earner families do not receive less in survivor benefits than those from single-earner families.", 
                "The RAISE Act would enable spouses who were married for less than 10 years to receive spousal and survivor benefits. It would extend benefits for young adults under 23 who are enrolled in school full time.", 
                "Crucially, to help ensure Social Security is there for future generations, the RAISE Act would shore up the Social Security trust fund in a fiscally responsible way that protects middle-class families. I believe strengthening and protecting Social Security benefits through the RAISE Act would do an enormous amount of help to our workers and families and their ability to stay financially secure.", 
                "But I also want to note there is a much broader challenge. There is not just one solution. We should absolutely make these critical changes to help make sure our Social Security system is meeting the needs of today's workers and families, but we also have to look at ways for workers to save for retirement and encourage companies to offer higher retirement plans.", 
                "That is not all. We need to make sure women get equal pay for equal work so they will have the same shot at a secure retirement as their male coworkers.", 
                "We do need to invest in education and training and get college costs down so our workers are prepared to compete for high-wage, high-skilled jobs.", 
                "We need to continue to fight to strengthen and protect programs such as Medicare which senior women and men rely on.", 
                "Democrats care deeply about taking these steps and many others to make sure our workers have the secure, dignified retirement they deserve. There is absolutely no reason why, after working hard all of her life, a retiree should have to worry about how she and her family will make ends meet.", 
                "I believe we can do better. I know Senator Begich does as well. I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a close look at our RAISE Act. I hope we can pass it to offer seniors and their families some additional relief. Then I hope we can build on this with other policies to create more opportunity and more financial security for our workers.",

                "This amendment would prohibit defense contracts to companies that don't provide equal pay for equal work. That is not a women's issue; it is a family issue. Families in San Diego and across the country increasingly rely on women's wages to pay bills, educate their children, and save for retirement.", 
                "Along with working to close the wage gap for women, this amendment codifies into law a Department of Defense policy that is already in effect to allow women in combat, and this amendment keeps our promise to servicemembers through the GI Bill.", 
                "Recently, Sallie Mae agreed to pay $97 million to settle allegations that military servicemembers were charged excessive interest and fees on their student loans. That is absolutely appalling and unacceptable.", 
                "The amendment would require an investigation of these deceptive scam practices, ensure that they are stopped, and would require in the future that borrowers are informed of their rights.", 
                "Our men and women in uniform and our veterans deserve our protection against fraud and to see that their GI Bill supports a high-quality education that leads to a high-quality job and nothing less.", 
                "Finally, with the drawdown in Afghanistan and the rebalance to the Pacific, many of our servicemembers are traveling extensive distances to and from deployments.", 
                "During this travel, many in uniform are being charged excessive baggage fees by commercial airlines. The amendment would prohibit airlines from collecting these fees, much of which is being charged on lifesaving equipment that servicemembers are buying and bringing in on their own because the Department doesn't supply what is necessary.", 
                "While it may seem like a small change, it will ease the burden on servicemembers. Charging baggage fees is not the way we should be sending off or welcoming home our troops.", 
                "In today's bill, we are authorizing nearly $600 billion. As we support our national security and defense abroad, we have the chance to promote economic opportunity and equal rights here at home. Our warfighters and all Americans who work to support them deserve nothing less.", 
                "Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Murray on the floor to stand up for America's women because it is time for a tough conversation about the economics of being a woman. I applaud her leadership, and I am very pleased she is bringing the women of the Senate to the floor today.", 
                "Women are working hard, earning their own way, and supporting their families, but they are not getting the same pay, the same security or the same respect. Take a look at the minimum wage. Two out of every three minimum wage workers are women. Women make up about three-quarters of all tipped minimum wage workers. A woman who works minimum wage can work full time and yet she will not earn enough to keep herself and a baby out of poverty. Minimum wage workers have not received a wage increase in 7 years. This is bad for women and it does not reflect America's value. CEOs got raises, managers got raises, but the women who cook and clean and care for our children are still stuck at the same $7.25 an hour they earned 7 years ago.", 
                "We could change this. If Congress would pass a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, more than 15 million women and their families would have more economic security, but Republicans have blocked this bill. They say they care about women, but they will not help the women who earn minimum wage or consider equal pay for equal work. I cannot believe I am saying this in 2014, but women still earn, on average, only 77 cents to the dollar what their male colleagues earn. Bloomberg analyzed the census data to find that in 99.6 percent of jobs, women get paid less than men. That is not an accident. That is discrimination.", 
                "Today, if a woman wonders if she is being paid the same as the guys are getting, she can, in some jobs, get fired just for asking. This is bad for women and it does not reflect America's values. We could change this by passing Senator Barb Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, a law that would make sure women do not get fired just for asking what the guy down the hall is getting paid, but Republicans have blocked this bill. They say they care about women but will not help the women who do the same work as a man but get paid less.", 
                "Consider health care. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2009, some insurance companies charged women higher premiums simply because they were women. Some insurance policies refused to cover preventive services for women such as mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. Pregnancy costs could be excluded and birth control coverage could be left out. In other words, affordable women's health care took a backseat to the profits of insurance companies.", 
                "But now we have the Affordable Care Act; women pay the same insurance rates as men. We have the Affordable Care Act; women get free coverage for mammograms and birth control. We have the Affordable Care Act; women can worry a little less about whether health problems will land them in bankruptcy.", 
                "Where are the Republicans? They want to repeal ObamaCare. The House has now voted more than 50 times to repeal ObamaCare. The Senate Republicans have come to the floor day after day to demand that ObamaCare be done away with. The Republicans say they care about women, but they will not help women pay for health care or get the full medical coverage they need at a price they can afford.", 
                "Women are working hard earning their own way and supporting their families. They are entitled to the same pay, the same security, and the same respect as men. Policies such as these--minimum wage, equal pay, and the Affordable Care Act--provide a measure of equality, better security, and some basic respect. Republicans want to block or repeal all three. Women are not asking for special deals. They just want a fair shot at building lives for themselves and their families.", 
                "The women of the Senate, the Democratic women of the Senate, are ready to fight the Republicans to make sure women across this country have their fair shot.",

                "I thank the Senator from Massachusetts again for all of her extremely hard and important work to expand economic opportunity and security for women and their families.", 
                "She has been an extremely important voice in this debate, and I am delighted she is joining us today.", 
                "Yesterday I held a hearing on this topic in the Senate Budget Committee. We invited a working mother, whose name was AnnMarie Duchon, to testify about some of the challenges that she had faced. AnnMarie told us that she loves her job at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, but since the day that she started, she made a lower salary than her male counterpart who was doing the exact same job. They had the exact same responsibilities. Both of them had taken a pay cut to accept that job, and they both graduated from the same university in the same year.", 
                "When AnnMarie found out that he was making more than she was--even though they had the exact same resume, qualifications, and years of graduation--she went in and asked for a raise. She was told that she couldn't have one.", 
                "She stayed on that job and continued to work hard. It wasn't until her husband's job was at risk that she started thinking about how much those lost wages meant to her and her family.", 
                "She ran the numbers, and she found out that over the years she had missed out on more than $12,000 in wages compared to her male counterpart who was doing the exact same work.", 
                "AnnMarie and her husband are first generation college graduates. They have a 5-year-old daughter who is in full-time daycare because both AnnMarie and her husband have to work.", 
                "AnnMarie told us yesterday that when she realized her lost income amounted to 1 year's worth of child care or 10 months of payments on their mortgage or student loans, she said that was heartbreaking. AnnMarie was ultimately able to go back and convince her employers--by showing them the math--to give her equal pay.", 
                "But as we know, unfortunately, most women are not able to do that and many don't even know that they are earning an unfair wage. That is a real loss, both for our families and for our economy as a whole.", 
                "We heard what $12,000 could have meant for AnnMarie's household budget, but women's contributions in the workforce have also made a huge difference to our overall economic strength.", 
                "As working families have felt more and more strained by the rising costs for everything from college tuition to childcare and health care, and an economy in which the gap between those at the top and everyone else seems to be getting wider and wider, women's economic contributions have helped ease the burden.", 
                "Economist Heather Boushey, who also testified yesterday at our hearing, found in a recent study that between 1979 and 2012 the U.S. economy grew by almost 11 percent as a result of women joining our labor force. As we think today about ways to support growth in the 21st century, it is absolutely clear our country's economic success and that of our middle-class families go hand-in-hand with women's economic success.", 
                "So we have a lot more work to do because despite all the progress we have made and all the glass ceilings that have been broken, women still face barriers that are holding them, their families, and our economy back.", 
                "Stories such as AnnMarie's--stories of women who received lower wages for the same exact work as men--are still far too common. Because women are more likely to be the primary caregiver in a family, the lack of paid leave at most jobs means women today experience higher turnover, lost earnings, and are more likely to be passed over for promotions that would help them advance.", 
                "In addition, our outdated Tax Code works against married women who choose to go back to work as a second earner because their earnings are counted on top of their spouse's. They can actually be taxed at a higher rate, and that deters some mothers from choosing to re-enter the workforce, especially when you consider the high cost and lack of access to high-quality childcare.", 
                "Those kinds of challenges are especially pronounced for women and, in particular, mothers, who are struggling today to make ends meet. We know that two-thirds of minimum wage earners are women. Their jobs are disproportionately unlikely to offer any flexibility when, for example, a child gets sick or needs to be picked up early from school. And their earnings are quickly swallowed by costs associated with work, such as childcare or transportation.", 
                "It is also important to note that our outdated policies disproportionately affect women when it comes to their retirement security because, on average, women earn less than men, accumulate less in savings, and receive smaller pensions. Today nearly 3 in 10 women over 65 depend on Social Security for their only income in their later years.", 
                "All of my colleagues and I should be alarmed that the average Social Security benefit for women over 65 is just $13,100 per year. Imagine living on that. That is not enough to feel financially secure.", 
                "The impact of these barriers is increasingly clear. Over the last decade the share of women in the labor force has actually stalled, even as other countries have continued to see more women choosing to go to work. Experts believe that a major reason for that is that, unlike in many other countries, in the United States we have not updated our policies to reflect our 21st century workforce and help today's two-earner families succeed.", 
                "At a time when we need to be doing everything we can to grow our economy and strengthen our middle class, that is not acceptable. Women have to have an equal shot at success. First and foremost, that means we need to end unfair practices that set women back financially.", 
                "We took a very good step forward with the Affordable Care Act, which prevents insurance companies today from charging women more than men for coverage--which they did before that Act. But we need to do more to make sure women are getting equal pay for equal work.", 
                "My good friend and colleague Chairman Mikulski has led the way on the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would provide women with more tools to fight paycheck discrimination. Giving the millions of women earning the minimum wage a raise--as Senator Warren just talked about--would also go a long way toward that effort. Of course, we have to update our Tax Code so that mothers who are returning to the workforce do not face a marriage penalty.", 
                "In addition to expanding the earned income tax credit for childless workers, the 21th Century Worker Tax Cut Act that I introduced would provide a 20-percent deduction on the second earner's income for working families with young children to help them keep more of what they earned.", 
                "As we get rid of these discriminatory practices, we should also recognize the challenges that working parents face, and we should put in place a set of policies that help them at work and at home. A big part of that is investing in expanded access to affordable, high-quality childcare. When parents go to work, they deserve to know that their child is safe and thriving while they are at work. There are many steps that this Congress could and should take through our Tax Code and by building on successful programs, such as Head Start, to help give working parents the peace of mind they deserve.", 
                "Finally, we need to build on and strengthen Social Security with policies that make it easier for women and their families to build a secure retirement. There is, of course, a lot more that we can do in addition, but I believe any one of those changes would have a real impact.", 
                "As the Presiding Officer knows from our Budget Committee hearing yesterday, AnnMarie testified and told us that she hopes when her daughter enters the workforce, pay inequity will be just as much of a relic as the days before the iPhone.", 
                "I could not agree more.", 
                "Acting to expand economic opportunity for women is the right thing to do. It is part of our ongoing work to uphold our country's most fundamental values. But as our country's recent history shows, it is also an economic necessity--both for our families and for our broader economy.", 
                "That is why it is so disappointing to see that when it comes to issues affecting women. Some of our Republican colleagues are laser-focused on turning back the clock. We saw this just yesterday when the senior Senator from South Carolina came to the floor and tried to pass an extreme bill that would severely limit women's reproductive rights.", 
                "Women today would much rather see Congress focusing on expanding opportunity and helping working families than on getting in between a woman and her doctor.", 
                "Over the next few months, we are going to see Democrats continuing to fight for goals such as achieving pay equity, providing access to affordable childcare, and raising the minimum wage--all of which would move women, families, and our economy forward not backward.", 
                "I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be willing to join us in this very important effort.", 
                "I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "Mr. President, I listened carefully to Senator Lindsey Graham, who put forward a very dangerous bill for women and their families in this country. I will explain in a moment why I think it is dangerous, but what was interesting is that I believe he said he brought it forward today because it is the anniversary that Dr. Gosnell was convicted and sent to prison. This is a rogue doctor who committed despicable and illegal acts and is now serving life in prison without the possibility of parole for what he did--abusing the trust of being a reproductive health care doctor. Dr. Gosnell is away, as he should be.", 
                "How does my friend from North Carolina commemorate this? By putting forward a bill that will drive more women to rogue doctors. If we make it illegal for a woman, regardless of her circumstance, she is going to find a way to save her health, her life, and her family.", 
                "Women deserve to have protections. The bill that my friend proposed simply says that after a certain number of weeks, an abortion will not be allowed no matter what a woman's health situation is, and that is very dangerous.", 
                "I ask--just rhetorically--how can a Senator say he is doing something right for women and their families when there is not a health exception? If a woman goes to the doctor and finds out she is facing cancer, kidney failure, blood clots or some other tragic complication, why should the government step into the middle of her family? Why should the government and U.S. Senators be allowed to step between the woman, her doctor, her God, and her family? It is a disgrace, especially from a party that is known for saying: Get Government off our backs.", 
                "This is horrible. There is no exception for rape or incest victims who are unable to report those heinous crimes. Let's say initially they were too frightened and then suddenly they get their courage. Well, too bad. Have your rapist's child. This is not a government that cares about families. This is a government that steps into our business at the most tragic moments of our lives.", 
                "The bill is so extreme that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents thousands of OB/GYNs, said these restrictions are ``dangerous to patients' safety and health.'' Who do you think stands up for the health of the women in this country? U.S. Senators or doctors who know the women, the family, and the circumstances of her health?", 
                "I have a letter from Christie, who lives in Central Virginia, and she said:", 
                "My husband and I were confronted with two equally horrible options--carry the pregnancy to term and watch our baby girl suffocate to death upon birth, or terminate the pregnancy early and say good-bye to our much-wanted and much-loved baby girl.", 
                "Why should a Senator tell her what to do? It is a war on women. When you tell a woman in that type of circumstance what to do and take away her right to use her mind, her brain, and the love she has for her family, her husband, and her children to make that decision, it is a war on women.", 
                "Christie was pregnant with her second child when that happened. She wanted this baby, but it was not until a 20-week ultrasound that she found out her daughter would suffocate to death at birth. What U.S. Senator has a right to make her watch that baby child suffocate to death? I am sorry, but that is not life-affirming.", 
                "Then there is Judy from Wisconsin. She says:", 
                "I know what it is like to live without a mother. My mother died when I was only 4 years old, and it changed my life forever.", 
                "Four months into her pregnancy, Judy developed a pregnancy-induced blood clot in her arm. The only guarantee she would not die and leave behind her 5-year-old son was for Judy to terminate the pregnancy. She and her husband made the very difficult decision to terminate that pregnancy.", 
                "What right does a U.S. Senator--who doesn't know her, doesn't know her husband, doesn't know her family history and how she lost her mother when she was young--have to step into that world at that moment and tell her what she has to do. Do we think so little of the women of this Nation?", 
                "We just had Mother's Day. We lauded our mothers. We are crying out for the girls who were taken by terrorists. If we all care, then why would we support legislation such as this?", 
                "Then there is Bridget's story. At the time, she was a 25-year-old mom looking forward to the birth of her third child. She initially had a normal ultrasound at 13 weeks. Her second ultrasound showed a major, complex fetal cardiac malformation, a fatal problem. Because tests could only confirm this fatal defect later in the pregnancy, she could not make a decision until after the 20 weeks.", 
                "What right does a U.S. Senator have to get in the middle of her most personal, most private, most difficult decisions? There is a place for government. It is to make life better for people. It is to say: We are with you. We have your back. We understand what you are going through. It is not to make life so difficult for people.", 
                "In Missouri, Julie and her husband were told relatively early in her pregnancy that the baby they were expecting had multiple abnormalities and would not survive outside the womb, but it took her 3 weeks to locate an abortion provider because they had shut down so many providers. They found out, under Missouri's restrictive laws, she would have to travel 2 hours to a facility on two separate occasions to comply with the State's 24-hour waiting period. When they were finally able to get the care they needed, her pregnancy was just over 20 weeks.", 
                "What right does any U.S. Senator have to step out there and tell the American people that we know better than their families know, that we know better than their doctors know, and that we know better than their clergy knows?", 
                "This bill targets doctors who risk their lives to help women who are at risk for paralysis, infertility, have cancer, and whose lives would be in danger if they continued the pregnancy. This bill would throw those doctors in prison for 5 years just for providing needed health care to their patients. ", 
                "I don't know what kind of country people envision when we have the government policing the private health care decisions of women and their families. Why would we want to go back to the last century and open battles that have long been fought? Those battles were fought in 1973 when Roe v. Wade was the decision of the Supreme Court, and do you know what that court said? They balanced all the rights--the rights of the fetus with the rights of the mother--and they said early in the pregnancy, a woman has the right to choose. It is her decision, but as she goes along with the pregnancy, then later, yes, there will be restrictions, and that is fine as long as the health and the life of the mother are in the forefront.", 
                "This legislation that Senator Graham wants to vote on--before it goes to any committee as Senator Blumenthal was saying--it is not what is best for women and their families or our communities, it is about an extreme rightwing agenda that needs to stop. This is a moderate country. We work together. I don't get everything I want, you don't get everything you want, but we work it out.", 
                "To come and offer legislation that is extremely dangerous to women is, in my opinion--I don't know what to call it. It is out of sync with what we ought to be doing. As Senator Baldwin said, we ought to be fighting, and she used that word ``fighting.'' We should be fighting for health care for women, fighting for the rights of our families, so they can have decent health care, and not putting rules in the books that are so onerous that a woman is desperate. I don't understand it.", 
                "I believe the Republican Party has moved so far to the right, it is unrecognizable to me. When I started out in politics--which was a long time ago--Republicans and Democrats worked together on the environment. Now we can't get a vote from them so we can ensure that the Clean Air Act is protecting our people. We can't get them to address climate change. We cannot get a vote from them. Maybe once in a blue moon we get a vote from one or two. George Herbert Walker Bush was the President who worked hard at Planned Parenthood, and that is where Republicans used to be. We would come together on protecting a woman's right to choose. There were more Republicans in Planned Parenthood than Republicans when I got started in politics. Now the Republicans want to run Planned Parenthood out. They want to shut down their clinics and stop all the good they are doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies.", 
                "I call it a war on women. We heard people say: Well, maybe there is such a thing as legitimate rape. Have you ever heard of anything so outrageous? We can't even get anyone to move forward on equal pay for equal work around here.", 
                "I am sad to say that I think this bill is part of the war on women. Clearly, they are the ones who will suffer, along with their doctors. We don't put women in grave danger. We don't put up legislation without a health exception. We don't step in the middle of our families' most difficult decisions.", 
                "Americans want us to focus on making life better for our families. They don't want us to create new health risks. God knows we have enough health stressors just breathing the air out there, getting the flu and everything else. We don't need legislation that restricts a woman's rights when she needs to have us at her back, helping her, making her safe. Let's not go back to the last century.", 
                "If somebody has a bill such as this, I hope they will let it go through the whole committee process. We need these women who I quoted today to look Senators in the eye and say: Senator, please stay out of my life. These decisions are difficult enough, but I know I can handle them with my family, with my God, with my support system.", 
                "Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. In the early stages, a woman has a pretty much unfettered right. As we go along, there are more restrictions. But we never, ever turn our back on a woman's health or her life. That is what Roe says.", 
                "Frankly, I hope this bill and others like it will not see the light of day because it could only make life very difficult for many of our families.",

                "Mr. President, one would think, now more than ever, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would recognize the American people really want us focused squarely on jobs and the economy. It is what every poll says. It is what the vast majority of all of our constituents say, and it is absolutely what is needed at a time when families, especially working women, continue to struggle to make ends meet. But instead of working with us across the aisle to give every American a fair shot, it seems as though Republicans are focused on something else entirely: Politics.", 
                "Today, the senior Senator from South Carolina came to the floor and attempted to pass a bill that not only undermines women's access to their doctors but restricts their rights to access reproductive health services. I am not sure what our colleagues think has changed since they last introduced this bill in November, but just as it was back then, this extreme, unconstitutional abortion ban is an absolute nonstarter. It is not going anywhere in the Senate and, as they know, it is a cheap political ploy. I would like to think that over the last 41 years, since the historic decision of Roe v. Wade, we have moved on from debating this issue. I would like to think that after four decades, many of those who want to make women's health care decisions for them have come to grips with the fact that Roe v. Wade is settled law. After all, many of the signs of progress are all around us.", 
                "In this Congress there is a record 20 women serving in this body. In 2012 women's power and voice at the ballot box was heard pretty loudly and clearly. In fact, when Republican candidates for office thought that rape was a political talking point, that idea and their candidacies were swiftly rejected, thanks in large part to the voices of women.", 
                "So sometimes it is tempting to think that times indeed have changed and that maybe, just maybe, politicians have finally realized that getting between a woman and her doctor is not their job, that it is possible rightwing legislators have a newfound respect for women. But the truth is that the drumbeat of politically-driven, extreme, and unconstitutional laws continues to get louder.", 
                "In 2013 our Nation saw yet another record-breaking year of State legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women's access to abortion services. In fact, in the past 3 years, more of these restrictions have been enacted across this country than in the previous 10 years combined. And anti-choice lawmakers here in our Nation's capital have filed 50 legislative attacks on reproductive rights in this Congress alone.", 
                "By the way, these haven't just been attacks on a woman's right to choose, they have been an all-out assault on everything from shaming pregnant women to drafting politically-driven legislation intended to create geographical roadblocks for low-income and racial minorities wishing to access safe reproductive services.", 
                "Not surprisingly, these States that have enacted some of the most extreme and archaic restrictions are also the same States that fail to achieve even mediocre standards when it comes to critical issues such as education and the economy. But despite these shortcomings, some Members of this body refuse to work with us to address those critical issues and instead want to distract the American public with these purely political bills until the small pocket of their extreme audience is satisfied.", 
                "In fact, according to the Senator from South Carolina, debating a woman's access to her own doctor is a ``debate worthy of a great democracy.'' The fact is it is a debate we have already had. This is a directed attack on Roe v. Wade, and it is attack on what is already settled law.", 
                "I wish to remind my colleagues today that real women's lives and the most difficult health care decisions they could ever possibly make are at stake.", 
                "Let me share with my colleagues the story of Judy Nicastro. She is from my home State of Washington. She bravely shared her story publicly in the New York Times. I have told her story before, but it bears repeating now because we are under attack again. In an op-ed she wrote, just days before the House passed a bill that was virtually identical to the one that was introduced today, Judy talked about being faced with every pregnant woman's worst nightmare.", 
                "In describing the news that one of the twins she was carrying was facing a condition where only one lung chamber had formed and that it was only 20 percent complete, Judy captured the anguish countless other women in similar positions have faced. ``My world stopped,'' she wrote.", 
                "I loved being pregnant with twins and trying to figure out which one was where in my uterus. Sometimes it felt like a party in there, with eight limbs moving. The thought of losing one child was unbearable.", 
                "She went on to say:", 
                "The MRI at Seattle Children's Hospital confirmed our worst fears: The organs were pushed up into our boy's chest and not developing properly. We were in the 22nd week.", 
                "Under the bill proposed today, the decision Judy ultimately made, through very painful conversations with her family and with consultation with her doctors, would be illegal. The decision to make sure, as she put it, that ``our son was not born only to suffer'' would be taken from her and given to politicians.", 
                "I am here today to provide a simple reality check. We are not going back. We are not going back on settled law such as Roe v. Wade or the Affordable Care Act. We are not going to take away a woman's ability to make her own decisions about her own health care and her own body.", 
                "Just as with the many attempts before this bill, there are those who would like the American public to believe that all of these efforts are anything but an attack on women's health care. They try to say it is a debate about freedom, except, of course, the freedom for women to access care.", 
                "It is no different than when we were told attacks on abortion rights are not an infringement on a woman's right to choose; they are about religion or States rights. Or when we are told that restricting emergency contraception isn't about limiting women's ability to make their own family planning decisions, but it is somehow about protecting pharmacists. Or as demonstrated last month when a Republican State lawmaker in Missouri introduced legislation to triple the State's mandatory waiting period for abortion services, claiming it would give women more time to do their ``research.''", 
                "Not that we should be surprised, he went on then to compare this deeply personal and difficult choice to that of purchasing an automobile saying: ``In making a decision to buy a car, I put research in there to find out what to do.''", 
                "The truth is this is an attempt to limit a woman's ability to access care. This is about women. Instead of playing a game of political football with women and their health, Republicans should instead consider joining with us in working on what women truly want.", 
                "Women today want to have a fair shot at success. First and foremost, that means not rolling back the clock or eroding the gains we have made. We took a very good step forward with the Affordable Care Act, which now prevents insurance companies from charging women more than men for coverage, ensuring preventive services such as mammograms and contraception coverage is covered and increasing access to comprehensive health coverage, thanks to the Medicaid expansion and the exchanges. There is no doubt we need to make sure women have access in this country to opportunities such as getting equal pay for equal work or giving the millions of women earning the minimum wage a raise, which would go a long way towards that effort. We need to update our Tax Code so that mothers who are returning to the workforce do not face a marriage penalty.", 
                "There is much more we could be doing to address the issues of concerned women. Those are the issues we ought to be focused on--how to move our country forward, not backward.", 
                "So if it wasn't clear the last time the senior Senator from South Carolina made this attempt, it ought to be clear now. Senators such as myself are not going anywhere. Advocates and doctors who treat those women every day and know their health must be protected are not going anywhere. And women who continue to believe their health care decisions are theirs and theirs alone are not going to go anywhere. By the way, the Constitution is not going to go anywhere. Therefore, this extreme bill that was offered today is not going anywhere.", 
                "Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."

It also creates 200,000 jobs.",

                "The Shaheen-Portman bill is a chance for a fresh start for the Senate--really a new beginning. We had been making some limited progress this year in moving legislation, starting with the Murray-Ryan budget arrangement. Then we worked together--Democrats and Republicans--to pass a childcare development block grant, a flood insurance bill, and an extension of unemployment benefits.", 
                "But as we considered legislation to help American families--like equal pay and a minimum wage increase--Republicans got off track, and working families did not get a fair shot.", 
                "So here we are, once again, confronted with the possibility that a good bipartisan bill may fail. And for what? Democrats have acted in good faith, and we have bent over backwards to make this bill work. But it seems our efforts are never enough. Each concession we make brings new demands.",
